going to share my favourites that are less popular
1. LensPort (we all need secondaries, and kudos to @lensport.lens for implementing royalties)
2. @pinsta.lens because its incredible that someone build pinterest-style app so quickly
3. @wav3s.lens allows to reward content aplification and users benefit from it
4. @memester.lens and rememe.lol just for the memes
5. @amnisiac.lens music player on Lens, desing is still rough but the functionality is epic

in par! few

Solar panels are quite decentralized energy source, who ever needs to know this

Congrats for the huge update !

lol eagerly waiting 😃

That Orb update 🔥🔥

So true ! another one

ETHDenver 🫡

now it make sense to me 🙂

nan

interesting thanks for the share, any particular that is has AI edge to it?

This is exactly what @wav3s.lens is doing on Lens 🔥

This publication is gated

I’m super stoked about Amnisiac, would love to see it evolve more and more

going to epic 👀

What are the best engineering schools in China?

Lensta = 1 🤳

Good old radio but on Lens 🎙

Most of the teams behind Lens apps are quite small which brings lot of agility and also shows how fast you can build web3 social

Lenster = 1
LensTube = 1
Buttrfly = 1
Orb = 3
Phaver = Few

How big are others?

Also depends a lot on the implementation. How the value can be transferred? Is the ledger public? What are potential restrictions? The levels of rug are real

simplified

My biggest issue with Metamask mobile is that it loads always 15 seconds before it opens, just too much

Whats the sentiment on Lens regarding CBDC? Good or bad for crypto?

Sickest @orbapp.lens update so far! Congrats @nilesh.lens & team! 🪐🔥

And all the news is quick, right to the point, the way I love it

I think it would have to be a network effect that on-board a crowd of artists that benefits from the space. Music industry has moved a lot when you have pockets of artists that believe in something, i.e. hiphop back in 80s and 90s

I get all my news from @chriscomrie.lens these days on @lenstube.lens 

lool

Epic explanation can't wait to be able to stake/unstake ETH on fly

Love it!

This is the future of content amplification 🌊

Epic, wen collects on 👀

whoop whoop! 🔥

Does anyone use the Apple App Store home screen for discovery to find new apps?

I haven't seen many projects that are building web3 customer support, but would imagine that Lens could be a good anchor or way to verify customer support staff 🫡

lol hilarious

Another cool Lens Dune dashboard where you can see profile data based on Lens profile https://dune.com/xmc2/lens-profiler

Thanks for the free collect ✌🏼

Here's my Lens Wrap 💚 whats yours https://lenswrap.tech ?

This is going to be exciting https://www.the402.xyz 🍿

The sky would fall on us, burning man would be cancelled, USD would be pegged to .lens, these are what come to my mind

Amazing and congrats! Zk will be very useful for various applications around Lens Protocol

Been playing around with Converse messaging app that has integrated Lens, got me thinking that would be cool to create messaging group chats next

This was one of the best ones you dropped!

NFT archaeology, thats a nice hobby

gm!

Need an easy stake recipe for tonight, prep time max 40 min. Any suggestions?

DigitalOcean seems to be super dev friendly, everyone is still using instead AWS or Google Cloud. What am I missing?

The lazers look so beautiful!

Liquid Staking Derivatives or something else o_O

its because Frankfurt is a AWS hub

goos point that Coinbase etc runs nodes

running nodes becoming easier, light nodes

indeed not that high number

its the second biggest region after US

Wondering whats the difference of restaking in EigenLayer vs. something like Avalanche where you use the main validators security for subnet, kind of the same end result?

lol securing

Distribution of Bitcoin nodes globally as per https://bitnodes.io/

Why 1/4 of all Ethereum mainnet nodes are still syncing?

Top 15 regions hosting Ethereum main-net nodes, suprisingly almost half in US

There are around 5,000 Ethereum main-net nodes securing the network

Anyone tried Tencent Cloud or Alibaba Cloud?

Kevin congratulations for both of you 👶 Sorry to hear about Jenya and hope she gets better, sending prays 🙏 keep us posted ✨

🚀

Sweet avocado! also welcome and super big fan of @wav3s 🫶

Any folks on Lens seen interesting use-cases for restaking? Using LSD for sexuring something else

Very useful advice, in most cases we all can change how we feel about certain things and being able to affect and change takes folks far

🍋

Wonder how are the acoustics there : o

Risk diversification for LSDs are here https://indexcoop.com/blog/introducing-the-diversified-staked-eth-index

What are the best blockchain books you would recommend to someone who is new in crypto? I recommend always to start with @camirusso.lens book The Infinite Machine that gives a good past context on Ethereum ecosystem.

Looks that its coming soon ™️

Exciting to see that Lemon chose the path to use decentralized protocols, specifically Aave Protocol! 👻

It seems that rollup economics are a hard game. Wondering how validators, sequencers and other ecosystems could be funded via rollup fees https://dune.com/niftytable/rollup-economics

Seems like rollups would need to find another way to monetize than network fees? What folks in Lens think?

Resident Evil 🔥

How could I forget it! Big yes

There is MetaMask for moving funds, also there is focalize.app to publish directly to Lens from a Chrome extension, nice expansion of decentralized interfaces for @lensprotocol 

Super cool!

when creators on Lens collab 💫

☕️

Good one !

Best game you ever played on PS1? I go first Metal Gear Solid. All the stealth stuff and gadgets (invisibility etc), also the alarm sound caught by guard is unforgettable feeling of sensation. Also the level of tactical thinking required has been unbeatable

damn I didn't know you could do that but sick to see that it actually works 🌲

Congrats and welcome!

I feel XMPT feels quite right direction on messaging, however I see the value of ENS as verified senders and recipients.

sick idea actually !

lmeow!!

Very good ! 🎹

So, whats the greenest stablecoin out there? 🌳

Pros you can monetize and build utility, cons is that you gate your audience behind a paywall

I feel the same way - using paid for all my followers would be too much but having super follow kind of paid follow would be something that I could provide more utility for super followers that pay

How could Lens users benefit more from the mirror feature?

Wondering if paid follows could be more utilized? What do people think? Worth it?

I like the Slack threads actually these days. First it was difficult to see if someone replied but now quite used to and feel intuitive. For the RE: title itself would rather use something more visual like a horizontal stack and color new stack as unread instead.

These charts are my favourite. Over 35k users on Lens are supporting other users by collecting their content 💚 and out of all users 16.88% are paid collectors 🙌 

Fascinating that 2727 (2.51% of all profiles) are revenue bearing. Best part is that anyone can start monetizing by setting fee for paid collects

Average revenue per profite that has monetization on Lens (https://dune.com/sixdegree/lens-protocol-creator-economics) 

In total the amount Lens users have been earning from collects, paid follows and mirrors

Here we go again https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-banks-crypto-exchanges-060028327.html

data showing that Lens users prefer shortest handles https://dune.com/springzhang/lens-nft-polygon-lenshub-lens-protocol-overview

Loved it !

This publication is gated

Nice idea and you could also even use the Toke Gated feature so only those who collect will get to hear the bits 

Happy Chinese New Year 💫

looks so good, maybe meetup around next ETHLatam?

pasta looks good 👍

anyone can build that if they want to but would not see anyone using it lol

interesting topic, credit scores do not passport from one country to another, however verified blockchain data does

correct

Might have been because I didn't follow you but do now : )

Blockchain for AI governance 🤔

I think its just browser suported WebGL that you are using, and the file itself is stored in data availability layer like IPFS or Arweave

haha well done 😃

Lens builders, have anyone tried in their teams role rotation / leadership / ownership rotation? What kind of findings that led to? Was it helpful?

Your social network is your identity

Where are all the delivery bots?

100%, really not worth to put too much focus on CVs, rather important to understand how closely candidates have been working on solving a particular problem, technical/substantial depth and also good personality/attitude is important as well. Most common pit falls I've seen over the market cycles is that growing startups hire upper management while still being in the seed or early stage.

ETHTokyo is happening this year. Any teams that are based in Japan that are solving interesting problems in web3?

Starting my day

Cant believe someone build so quickly @pinsta.lens 

Saved this into my music  @pinsta.lens  board

gm these are cool, wen can collect the earings 👀

Didn't know that there was an element of networking lol but yeah, hard to see ROI besides putting on Linkedin for many

Interesting take, wondering if could be helpful for founders as well that are building 500-5000 staffed companies

smart

yes exactly, limited edition, limited edition paid collects 🔥

What if you drop the game on Lens? For exampel the browsers support OpenGL, and also the content istored in Arveawe or IPFS, could be cool. Here is some guides how you could use OpenGL with IPFS but also probably works if you directly drop it here? https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-create-a-unity-game-on-ipfs-using-pinata-d0af18a5bd44

Congrats !

Cool to see @LensPort improving so much over time. Couple of things I would suggest is that creating content could reflect instantly by using the Optimistic Lens API. Second is that the feed could specialize on content that is getting collect traction and make it all about collect economy in feed and recommendations.

I mean, just thinking overall whats the sentiment especially for folks that already have decent startup experience.

This week most traded and top collectors on LensPort, I really think 1/1 and 5-10 mints are good way to get follower audiences existed to collect and support. Cool to see that new folks are entering into the collect game ✨

Honest question, are MBAs worth the time?

Coming a bit late here but been recently thinking about Validiums and new use-cases https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/

Teenage engineering but with web3

ya its a scam

Looks very surreal

What if instead of looking at the price of a token, you would have a metric that measures how many addresses are voting, how many delegates there are, how many proposals has been passed, engineering effort and how much DAO treasury there is as a metric instead?

Who are the active solo DAO governors? @lemiscate @monetsupply.lens @lucasvo.lens comes to my mind

credit scoring not passporting between countries is such a legacy practice in a world where people migrate and move between countries

Love the idea of 1/1 for photos!

Microsoft is vested into OpenAI

Agree using VCs as ecosystem/BD but also there are some who help on the product design i.e. IDEO CoLabs

Probably the most scariest content I collected so far : )

What are the VCs in web3 space that you feel are doing good job at helping founders?

wow, first thing I would do is to go to sauna! Spend time in the nature and just watch TV, White Lotus or new season of Love Island 😃

Fixed another one

There, I fixed it

Who is building in public? 🫡

Any idea how Gotenks looks IRL?

So funny, I deployed a game with OpenGL/Unity on IPFS and its still running after 2 years https://patient-queen-0592.on.fleek.co/

You can access the game through any IPFS gateway https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaFTyhquHagSJnUE7Pv3TpADKmEUcAijVEQ1tGjkiKjnu/

The game is just the basic frag game with slight modifications

Very interesting thanks for the share, unstoppable games!

Welcome!

Thank you for your writing, really important to take care of mental health and burn out is quite common in the web3 space. Really good pointers and most important for me is to taking care of yourself. Life can't be rotating around work and we all need to take breaks from time to time. 🙏

So jelous that @carstenpoetter.lens got the 1/1 🔥

Who are the recent joiners on Lens you all recommend to follow?

Are you getting better recommendations as Who to Follow?

If you are an artist that dropped a NFT collection, let say 500 NFTs, but you would like to continue adding more NFTs to add story to the collection, would that be appropriate?

Super cool ! Keeping my eyes open for this one

Nice where was this?

Quite good tapes, any possibility to drop some music on Lens? Peeps would love to collect

Whats the latest sentiment on Lens on social recovery? Would folks be willing to share portions of their keys with peers?

lols

me too 😢

gotcha so should say something like the fee follow module not supported, wish there could be a way to avoid the apple cartel

Wondering if the error message is correct here?

my biggest challenge with Tezos ecosystem and also Solana is the lack of EVM, because you cant deploy same protocols as in Ethereum written in Solidity, there is less things to do atm but its not really a showstopper for folks who want to mint and collect NFTs there

Love the idea of bookmarking pictures across Lens protocol, would love to see a personalization algo built in to find this that are exciting

What could that be ?

WalletConnect is actually quite good solution, would be actually more interesting if there could be some kind of modules provided as well, that would allow to manage your mobile wallet completely form the web app in any app

I'm continously amazed how web3 is fueling the careers for many in the creator space, thanks for sharing your story and welcome to Lens 🌿

Drop it like its 🔥

My 2023 is looking forward to that

wowo 👀

Reminds me that my whole team needs portraits too ! 

Amazing drawing, collected 

Welcome and epic saxxx 🎷

Devs, feel free to test out the Lens SDK v 0.2.0 and share the feedback 🙂

Wondering if @buttrfly.lens could show these epic features: quoted posts and bookmarks on the actions bar with icons?

Bookmarked this post 🔖

Someone is cranking up the memes recently on Lens

There must be a better way to connect a mobile wallet into a web application than using a browser extension. Thoughts?

looks useful

what kind there are so many, I like Stormzy and Dave

cute

Nice congrats and feel free to drop videos and bytes into @lenstube.lens

Whats the best rap recently? what do you listen, need rap alpha

gm London always nice to be back

they grow so fast

I’m curious about the wine drunk tab 👀🍷

gmmmmm and welcome 🌿

Lens follow module idea, you can follow me only if the price of ETH is below 4k. Want to keep my audience bera based. Powered by @chainlink.lens

would also prefer to see folks that interact beyond certain threshold with my content. Collects are perfect because you will see who are supporting you and also mirror stats to see who are the followers that amplify your content

nice try

Anyone used ChatGPT to plan what to eat 👀

Say it, collect it

there are quite lot of folks in their org that actually secretly love Lens lmeow

Looks quite cool, collected as well, cc @nilesh.lens

I find the double hover quite helpful

Davos is so funny, met folks that were in our first ETHLend meetup years ago in Germany after first 10 minutes walking on the street, crypto has a good stickiness factor

Anyone from the Lens community in Davos this week?

This is super smart, going to figure out how we could ise the hack internally at Aave to follow all the industry news

i wonder what was the reason

Very helpful insights 

Very good point, we will definitely need to get more creator frens on Lens, we do have quite an amazing community already but in matter of time I think if we keep spreading the word we will see more artists coming to Lens, given you can drop your NFTs directly to your audience

Not bad for 16 days

Honestly, I've never used Solana either 😃

9-5

😂 have to know what people think 

Cool stuff, try also the Token Gated Feature on Lenster 🌿 hope you have a good start for 2023 : )

Never underestimate the power of napping

lmaoooo

Whats the Lens sentiment on Solana?

super helpful, makes internet more nicer : )

tru

Would be interested to experiment the fact checking, not sure how effective it would be on new information and events, however for older facts could work well

Would love to see also chatGPT somehow integrated easily into Lens 👀

I love the tl;dr idea especially for example time-based feed. Getting a tl;dr what happened during the past 24 hours in Lens would be cool. Good idea to build!

Interesting idea 

Could be hilarious

This is super interesting idea for dapp browser, especially if you could set different kind of permissions.

Did you know that anyone can become a delegate within the Aave DAO and receive delegations to participate in governance. More on the delegate platforms https://governance.aave.com/c/delegate-platforms

I've seen it happen more than often - what can help is to build in public. Ensuring that users are able to contribute to ideas, whats being build and also participate in discussions.

Correct! ⛷

Very close 🙂

its even harder lol

Guess where

Three interesting challenges I want to share from product building perspective that might help other fellow builders here on Lens

1. What are you trying to solve?

Serious question, especially for web3 products. Decentralization as a product, will only get you as far as the firm believers. To cross the line, how is your web3 product faster, better and stronger than anything else out there?

2. Keep the product simple



It might be intuitive to think that feature rich products are what keep the users coming back. However, most successful products do start with a simple offering, focused to the main objective the product is solving. What is the main thing you want to solve with your product? How could you provide this utility with least friction and distraction? Once you get your product in a place where it has the most straighforward way to achieve its goal, you are in the right track. You often might hear the sentence "talk to your users", something that you hear from Y Combinator. Understanding what customers want and think about our product would help to achieve to build the parts that eventually makes your product feature rich, based on what are your users needs.

2. Don't build everything at once

Start with the main feature, what your product is built to solve in the first place. Less is more, and you are able to ship faster and iterate. Don't be afraid to ship shitty code or designs, its okay in the beginning but iterate to improve.

Oh man is this you ?

What could be interesting usecases for ChatGPT and Lens?

Prague!

very true, have to get headshots for the Aave fam

Would be epic to see if meme creation apps could add also the possibility to add music into the meme, that could unlock some cool new meme templates

See you in Tel Aviv yall

Gm from St Moritz

It makes sense, I think that will definitely happen over time

Which one 👀

This could be super cool!

POAPs new website is cool https://poap.xyz/

Encouraging everyone to participate 🙌

Could definitely get refresh, I heard the team is working on that 👀

Where would you want to see a Lens integration within web3?

Walked that street 3 years to my Uni - good memories, weather not so 🙂

How could @lensport.lens be improved? what could be good ideas to improve secomdary markets of user generated content?

you mean music? kind of just important to match the beats

1) definitely agree that more focus on power users would be amazing


2) leaderboard are always fun and definitely good ideas not to mention streaks 🥰

3) I think this is going to be improved cc @yoginth.lens 

Could store that in some other level, i.e. Arweave

Welcome to your digital garden 🌿

Who is following White Lotus 👀

@donosonaumczuk.lens has a solution :)

yes Lenster, I am going to do a round for each app build on Lens and how could be improved

Very goos point and good problem to solve

maybe some issue cc @yoginth.lens

stickers 😍

whats the need to deploy in other chains?

there are already

paid polls is interesting you mean you set a reward to answer to a poll?

definitely Lenster mobile app would be great down the line there are actually nice mobile experiences now with @orbwagmi.lens @phaver.lens and @buttrfly.lens

Happy Monday!

Sent a DM : )

How could @lenster.lens be improved? Need honest feedback

Amazing to collect this art during full 🌝

Excited about the update 👀

EthMarrakech

There should be an @ethglobal.lens hackathon in North Africa. But where? 🤔

It’s quite interesting take, and I think also what scares people is the unknown on how to adapt into the new era and also how we ensure we can control AI not to harm us

interesting to see that Zerion is picking traction

What city is that in the background?

Should humans be scared of AI?

Guitar and music in general is a path to learn live

to cut better fries 🍟

wait 👀

Maybe the way we will teach in the future will change, some adoptions needs to in schools regarding the speed of information

For what purpose?

Interesting point - something that is very undervalued and not educated at all

When AI thinks and acts better than any human - would it even mean that AI could understand philosophy better than humans?

Whats incredible is that when you publish on any of the Lens apps such as Lenster you can set that your post can be commented by "Friends" or "Friends of Friends" and you can deside the degree factor from 2-4. The feature is exactly based on degree of separation and is enforced by the smart contract module. For example if you set 3 degrees, it means that only folks you follow, they follow and who they follow follow can comment on your post :) it´s quite effective way to mitigate bots as well

I saw from LensTube bytes someone is building messaging app Converse, any idea whats the profile handle here on Lens?

Lunch smells fishy :p

What could be creative ways of using metadata? And what kind of information metadata should store?

Shopify enters into heads down mode by cutting meetings. I think would be interesting to create tokenized internal meeting credits to setup meetings. This would bring consciousness of cost of time and plan meetings well ahead.

Some interesting meeting token economics could be derived. You need to burn a meeting token to create a meeting but you would be rewarded by participating in one. Could be also exciting use-cases for external calls as well.

Reddit's early user acquisition & retention strategy: come for the nsfw - stay for the science

Building in public helps a lot in understanding user sentiment, what they would like to see in a product. Definitely recommend for applications build on top of Lens to take most out of building in public. Your early users are what gives a path for your product.

What else you need for game console controller?

Kind of having mixed feelings about Ronaldo joining Al Nassr. Signing extremely talented players for new regions is always good exposure for new markets for football but at the same time, seeing Ronaldo going there because he believes the vision feels a bit weird to me. 

quite interesting data about Lens on the Dune dashboard made by @sixdegreelab.lens https://dune.com/sixdegree/lens-protocol-ecosystem-analysis

There was a temp check recently so it looks that its happening https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xaba8da3287788ee77013aa6b0584694807dc15304ab5c283fe1fc728bf1d5864

Always been this

The work and effort it takes, wish life would be simpler

interesting questions, I could imagine that GHO could a good utility for excisting on-ramps however in general would like to see more the web3 GDP increase and see folks accepting GHO as means of payment and for salaries as well

Can be handled either on middleware level such as Lens API or for example on app-level, end of the day the protocol should be permissionless but reach should depend on what users want to see

Nice to see that you can add a personally curated list on @buttrfly.lens and see content from Lens users from that list, for example you could create a list of all NFT artists you want to follow

New LensPort interface is loooking good! 🔥

Nice, any upcoming events this year? I saw there was ETHAtlanta as well

You mean servicing the needs of those who need it the most?

Wouldn't increase of production lead to increase of demand for resources and again increase of the cost of resources and therefore inflation?

damn i didn't know a web3 brewery existed, how were the beers?

Want to write more content during 2023 - I used to write a lot of blog posts but short form content has taken that away from me. Any tips from those who actively write on how to get back in writing?

Have you ever paid your IRL expenses with crypto?

Using web3 social graph as a reputation score outside of social

👀

Hypothetical question, if everyone on the planet gets 5000 USD as UBI, wouldn't that just increase the inflation to the point where that amount of money looses its purchase power?

Very cool congrats for releasing the song, sounds good 🙂

nice thats epic ! easier ux for those who store their profile on ledger right

How is the creator and crypto scene there?

Chicago could be super cool might fuck around and fly over : )

Ljubljana definitely would be good location especially since I think there aren't that many crypto events there but lot of usage. Looks also good for cost perspective to do even a more bigger event. What is that lake in the picture?

Exciting topic, especially helpful for every project building web3

Welcome @proofofhumanity.lens to Lens 🌿💚

damn never knew there was one with cheese, epic

Absolutely incredible ! nice city view in the background

Interesting DeFi experiment from Ampleforth on creating inflation-adjusted asset with with the use of rebasing and risk tranching. Worth for read https://blog.ampleforth.org/spot-the-inflation-resistant-store-of-value-87e8112468b2

so incredible to see the progress well done @0xmoe 👏

ready to ape in hard

good idea as well

yes ser 🚀

What you would like to see build on Lens that doesn’t exist yet?

gm

Its 2023, in which cities Lens meetups should be in?

Congrats 🎊

I think Enzyme Finance is doing something similar and there are some amount of Yield aggregators out there

Love the Orb commmunity feature

For @aaveaave.lens 👻



2022 was 🚢

2023 will be 🚢🚢🚢



Big thanks to the Aave community and to everyone who believe in us - incredible thanks to our team, without our team effort it wouldn't be possible 💚 Looking forward to build more DeFi in 2023 💫

gm and Happy New Year Ryan!

amazing to see you here and shame what happened with Celsius

What does ecosystem mean to you?

Super cool ! where was this? 🙂

The more I think about it blockchain is perfect for registering volunteered effort - which is perfect for initiatives for reducing climate change

Congrats! I am a big enthuasist for using blockchain for climate change, where I could read more how the verified carbon units work?

Congrats!!!!

2022 was the year for @LensProtocol main-net 🌿 want to thank the whole Lens community, the community devs, the users, the creators, the partners and our whole team for all the contributions 💚 2023 is going to be exciting for Lensverse 💫

yes ser but even in Portals I someone would need to transfer underlying or you mean the port will just mint aTokens and still keep the principal on Ethereum for let say fixed period like 180 days? it does introduce some credit risk

This was the best ever home made chicken burger

get in my belly

Welcome to Lens 🌿

wow this badge is cool where can I get one

Wen Lens meetup there 🌿

Your fav VCs with GPs younger than 30? show me the young blood

Have some good memories from EthSplit 😎

Winamp, I miss you so much

Whats the best way to keep your USDC Aave Protocol deposit principal on Ethereum main-net but capture the yield on Aave Protocol on Polygon market instead?

Last week of 2022, how do you feel?

for sure there is a timeline, but how do you put a price on biodiversity?

How to measure the economic value of biodiversity? 🌳

Croatia?

gm James! 

I know ! This is mission impossible for now lol

That is true ! Hampstead ponds seems the best option for now 🙂

Such a great idea would fit well for @pinsta.lens 

Collected this ! I don't collect tweets but I do collect Lens posts. There are various reasons to collect, in some cases I want to support or show gratitute, in some cases I think what I collect might be culturally relevant. This is an interesting post about Collects being the new likes https://d.mirror.xyz/lUiKkOJnMSHqXE_jOncAVdWC05cnwPRLYkoGn3iU4kY

I love England but finding a decent lake to swin is a huge mission

Actually I think the Lens community will allready start hosting meetups during 2023 in decentralized fashion and our team has plans for few as well

Metadata is so undervalued, one of the most exciting use-cases for metadata is to share the story of the content, imagine if every song you like, you could read the backstory from metadata 🤯

Umbelivable! amazing 🔥

Touch grass

love love the composability 💚

What was Elons Health Factor

WAGMI

I’m drunk. AMA.

damn this sounds terrible hope all is good, please be safe out there people 🙏

Yeah this was my concern - is it actually helpful when you consumer more as long as you offset 🤔

I mean.... climate change has been a political movement in pop culture, Al Gore was a politician but nevertheless I think green energy is the way to move towards more decentralized energy, meaning there is a good opportunity for people to govern their own systems.

these folks are amazing 😻definitely power users that make me come back everyday

Shoutout to @jessyjeanne.lens for bringing so many folks to Lens 🫶

Whats the most interesting "ungovernance" ideas you've seen recently?

Built on @memester-xyz.lens

Follow @0xfran.lens from Superfluid for some good builder / product discussions

Currently there is a flag for NSFW when you post on app level but down the line would see it being solved 1) app level 2) reach level on middleware

yes it has happened 😅

There is also a chat 👀

its hard to imagine anymore world without tech like iphones, google, gps on your constant availability, you get much more out of a journey without the tech

which cocktail is the most confusing? 🍸

I’m trying to read it but the text is too small 😅

All I ask for Christmas is summarized balance 🎄

I really think @ricburton.lens needs to bring Balance app back! 👀

Voice channels on Lenster could be siiiiiiick !

Make sense - thinking also how we could use blockchain to accellarate some of the components, either funding or building more green energy

I personally feel green energy could be very decentralized given the nature of it

Interesting, do you think Carbon should be re-valued. I.e. Carbon that is produced has value of X and carbon that is captured has a value of Y? Just thinking how we could apply "negative interest rate" on carbon similar to economics for making money cheap or expensive depending on market conditions BUT without actually letting the end consumers to pay for it (which is hard to achieve)

gm everyone who chose Lens 🌿

Creators create ✨

Collected to support 🫶

Definitely think off-chain assets will grow a lot over the next couple of years, USDC is a great example of a scalable off-chain asset, next most likely will be credit, Centrifuge is doing great job

interesting what could be example use-cases for blockchain in Health sector?

I have a feeling we will see some interesting DeFi use-cases in 2023 with the real economy

Using pretty much @lensta.lens for photo discovery

I'm really bullish on seeing more gaming companies adopt web3 and especially for giving the ownership of the assets to their users by tokenizing in-app currencies and as NFTs

Very cool - is saving as the same as collecting or is it bookmarking to a table?

I always forget to set my posts to be collectible lol

Big thanks for the Lens community for creating an incredible space to hang. Lens Protocol has been on mainnet for less than 6 months, regardless being so early, I feel we are building the future of social spaces. ✨🌿

The upper right corner one 🧁👀

hmmmm I know this place 🤔

write on paper and fax to yourself

Virtual Padel could be cool

Followed 🌿

do it 👀

Lens turkey 🍽

What do you think about carbon offsetting? Is offsetting carbon production scalable or the path to become carbon neutral humanity?

Works for everything! 🍷

Merry Christmas and happy holidays @punkess.lens 

nan

Whats the best sauce for turkey?

Amazing morning show as usual thank you Jessica ☕️☀️

Loved the interview - privacy is very important topic to solve upon the next years in web3, thanks for the episode

Congrats Moe, amazing update have just an issue in signing in with Lens with metamask

Anyone having issues signing with Lens on @buttrfly.lens ?

@buttrfly.lens supports now Pinned Posts 📌

Lensta ux & design is getting quite nice, well done @arturs.lens 👏

right way on the rocks!

Thank you, very calming, collected as well

Looks incredible 😍

Nice LoFi xmas beat 🎵

Go and set your profile interests in Settings. This will improve your user experience down the line when we will see devs building more open algos on top of Lens Protocol 🌿

Buildooors, remember to take time off during holidays, DeFi, web3, NFTs, DAO will be here in 2023 as well

Potatos

Anyone like Mulled Wine?

你好 👋🏻

Amnisiac is quite cool very plain but does the job well in playing Lens based music in the background 🎵

Anyone having issues for @buttrfly.lens not opening up on iphone 12 pro max?

Tumeric

gm looks like a good place to ski

Love the one with Ethereum logo : )

Welcome to Lens 🌿 yes all content can be collectible as NFTs meaning you can drop directly your music on Lens Protocol and all the apps reflect it. Arweave works great and Lens is bringing ownership of your social media profile and your audience to you

This one was quite good, beautiful, calm

Wowo

amnisiac.xyz is super simple and plain but have to say its already running on my background while working 🎵

Decentralized music streaming is evolving on Lens 🎵 https://www.amnisiac.xyz/

Nice just found it myself 🎵

Collective welcome to all newcomers to Lens 🌿feel free to introduce yourself below and what you are most excited about ✨

Looks like a school I went to when I was a nugget

@orbwagmi.lens is now available for all Lens profile owners 🌿🪐🥳 download from orb.ac for iOS

welcome 🪐

gm 🪐

going to be an interesting read :)

I think this is a good choice, posting content to Lens audience solely is the key for getting more people curious about being part of the Lens community 🌿

Music NFTs taking off 🚀

great idea ☕️

Lool 👌😅

One cool thing would be getting included into the lyrics

gm - nice pic 🙂

Lensta UX is getting better and better 🤳

gm and welcome to Lens 🌿

Going to be fun, based on the last tweet "careful what you wish for" means he didn't expect that result. Maybe the person he has in mind would someone bizzare

Reflect is good build by @m1guelpf.lens https://reflect.withlens.app/

Welcome ! 🌿

lol so true

Looks incredible - must be amazing now in BA

Very beatuiful - as usual 🎹

Very good 🔥

indeed

So many requests today to allowlist for minting Lens profile - prolly the all time high

👀

I think he is trying to change twitter into some sort of entertainment/news platform

I have always seen internet win together, thats how many platforms supported each other since its a win win. web3 is actually based on the foundations of composability by default and  “we all can win together” ethos. I like to call that web3 is a multi-player game where anyone is welcome to enjoy the game together

Can someone send footage from Buenos Aires? how is the vibe there now

Did Messi just became a sheikh? 😂

I’m sure @vitalik.lens was watching the game

Told you so

Next rAAVE will be in Buenos Aires

So I will collect my own post lol

the best final ever

Yalla Messi!

Lets be honest the best world cup ever

agreed

The best thing about this game now is that’s its unclear who will win

pick your team 🫡

Its Messi vs Mbappe

France is testing in prod with new players

Happy Sunday 🌿

France coach changed players :0

Messi scores against France in World Cup finals

gm

both teams started strong, Arg had more opportunities

watch a profile without following

would work well in Finnish archipelago

Post your predictions below for Argentina 🇦🇷- France 🇫🇷will collect the right answer, max cap 5 matic collect for max 3 right answers. My prediction is Argentina wins on penalties ⚽️

One of my advice for web3 founders and product folks is to map out the audience they are going after. I think you can build a better product if you narrow down who you want to serve even within web3

interesting you mean that you could achieve good sound properties with digital?

would you loose the actual sound quality if you go from digital to analog, I suppose? I am more thinking of having as analog setup for the sonic experience

gm !

Anyone has experience with Reel to Reel recorders to play music? Whether its worth it for the sound quality? Afaik understood that these machines are for the best sonic experience, seeing lot of second hand ones now on the market with quite affordable prices

I would definitely want to see more app specific algos that provide different experiences on Lens, would be powerful

Good design 🎨

Wow super cool Lens kicks

Really love to read my news from Apple News these days

yes allthough would mean that you need to create a SC wallet as a transaction, which might be a bottleneck for some...

did LMCC

Whats the 2fa equivalent in crypto?

I bet @tamrat.lens knows 3D folks

How do you quantify economic value of biodiversity?

Last weeks of the year - good time to charge some energy for the next year 🧘🏻

Thats 1000 you have full ownership! 🔥 congrats

Absolutely legendary clip to watch if you are into product design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYGFbtYwYwI

lol then we have to throw a rAAVE

Looks v cool

Wondering how good is this

Cool to see @LensPort supporting token gated posts 🔥

It worked ! very nice pic ; )

totally the issue is that pretty much everyone is using github, but would also like to hear id anyone has used Radicle, a more decentralized option?

looks much cleener 👌

Every social media has reputation score baked into their algos, would love to see public rep scores and see how they accumulate over time

So much good content on Lens, from music to art to news to memes. It’s just the beginning

omg this is dope, Lens x Orb 🪐

wondering what is the outcome 👀

lol super hilarious

LFG

Should there be a rAAVE in 2023?

How would you explain POAP to a non-crypto person?

Love the people here

Is there chatGPT for music?

I think the issue is the amount of time you need to spend to make voice AI very good, to train it very well but I hear you - Siri hasn't been the best voice AI and would like to see improvements there

Thanks for dropping and sharing them with the Lens community 💚 excited to listen your new songs ☺️

Chad move @tamrat.lens !

GM 🌈

So when you post content, the on-chain transaction is a simply a link that reflect where the content is stored, either IPFS or Arweave depending how the apps have designed it - then some apps might use some improvements to fetch the content but some take raw from these data availability layers. Maybe @yoginth.lens and @nilesh.lens has more insights

Something that I once was thinking is that would be cool to do a poker game where you stake your aTokens from Aave and the winner wins everyones yield could be fun especially if the tournament is multiple days and there are multiple players

I just voted on "lens 2022 mixtape" https://snapshot.org/#/💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿.eth/proposal/0xd2bb68ddff06597e10a3a83cfb11850be5f15cc6de3e054a53a3f836f59b09c7 #snapshotlabs

This is so good - and thanks for making it rare - going to be fully collected i'm sure

If you are still wondering whether NFTs can scale to mainstream, take a look https://dune.com/polygon_analytics/reddit-collectible-avatars

🎯 thats a great goal

Would love to see bot accounts on Lens posting all kinds of interesting data, if you are interested in building a uswful bot that posts or mirrors send me a DM on Lenster (or @buttrfly.lens now ) to get a bot handle (proof of code will be needed)

Lens has the best biodiversity 🌳

also this post pretty much has all the amazing music folks people should follow on Lens

love the vote going to cast as well 🗳

Hey all follow my friend @justinholmes.lens he plays music in various ETH hackatons and events 💚

Welcome Justin super amazing to have you here in Lens 🌿

gm! and welcome to Lens 🌿

I'm super excited about the Refraction drop and how its been going - big kudos to the creators for doing it here on Lens amongst the community 💚 and super kudos to @bradorbradley.lens and @christina.lens for all the work to make it happen 💚💚 now its time to become a collectooor!

Generative art is also very natural, nature is generative and good example is that walking outside in the public you see generative motions and unexpected results. Something I want to see more is pairing generative art with the idea of Chaos Theory

This is so cool ngl https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x015c17-0x1b

YES

Would be relatively easy to do tbh - but, that means you would follow anyone that follows you regardless right o_O

Love the fish https://gallery.refractiondrops.com/post/0x019ed2-0x04 🐟

That was close for Morocco !

Omg the France Marocco game so exciting ⚽️

A way to create a community with that has some web3 features as well

I was sure this was a sunset ! quite nice

Is there anyone building a long-form text app on Lens Protocol that has a good focus on the markup/editor tooling?

Anyone tried geneva.com ?

I wonder how many Reddit NFT holders are there? Do you hold one?

Are you ready? ⚽️

Gm 🌿

I wanna wear that jacket :D

Epic background story 😅

Love it

Welcome to Lens 🌿

It became an interesting game! I could see a lot future being about fighting for good use of tech

Latest stats between client usage between apps - tl;dr they are all popular lol

also lot of new apps hence growing the "other" section

The school system would need to change by now to accomodate how we learn today

There are some good photographers on Lens, been following @goodkrak.lens who else you've been following?

I've been catching up with my DMs on Lens and have to say that my inbox has lot of product ideas, pitches, demos - super excited to see how the product culture is evolving on Lens 🏗

Incredible shot !

Word on the street is that @naomi.lens & gerzeljTimotej are building @letsrally.lens  - where you can chat voice to your Lens frens 📢 Can't wait to see community calls hosted in decentralized fashion 🌿

This is a big tease given how much I love Tel-Aviv - I heard Tel-Aviv blockchain week is happening next year 👀

omg this is so cool to see now happening ✨

This would be amazing, we are constantly thinking about productivity on our team and would love to hear more your thoughts

quite epic, I love to collect those posts that have fixed collect amounts like 5-10 👀

gm, the snow is missing from the picture ❄️

Sorry to hear about your thoughts - but I have to say you have the freedom to say anything you want end of the day - the Lenster verification has nothing to do with Lens Protocol, in fact you can fork Lenster and create your own digital garden. Your attacks definitely are hurtful and shocking to me but I understand if you have frustration thats okay. Wish you all the best.

wondering if it could work with xmtp?

is there any way to brute force dark mode across the internet?

legendary I think there is some classical music scene there

London turned into Helsinki ☃️

true you could share fees amongst the writers from collects

What are the things you can build with Lens that you can't build with traditional social media?

Nice set - what do you think about btw rotary mixers ?

Looool this was lmao

Wow so snowy - and also the sky is orange, I bet there is lot of lights around

This is pretty much a reality now lol

This month's top collectors one LensPort 🔥

What are the odds that France and Croatia would be in final again 😅

Can’t believe London does not have a decent Moroccan restaurant 🤔or am I not looking at the right places?

Whats the best country music you like? Also I saw few country musicians on Lens please tag them 🤠

Lens profile is a forever profile

LFG

reminder :)

I mean that explanation does feel like a community, wondering if there is more to it. I feel we need “ask ChatGPT” button on Lens lol

i think what you are saying is that you prefer tight communities comparable to families ?

This is an incredible take. I do feel that a commmunity is true when you can get support and give support when members need it @ricburton

very exciting take, can you also share the best Sonar rooms 👀

i love this! what does fellowship mean to you?

interesting take, what does frequency aligned mean?

Savage but I own this meme now

What does a community mean to you?

Really happy for Morocco today - it was a sad day for my Portuguese frens but I really think Marocco exceeded expectations

omg

How many more chances England will get :o

Learned more about Molens - there are so many cool projects being build on Lens, and  @chriscomrie.lens  you explain then quite well

Morocco, the first ever team from Africa went to semi-finals ⚽️

Anyone has an issue where your ISP is blocking IPFS or Areeave images?

What are you building?

time for GHO

Anyone building app on Lens that focuses on mental health?

lol

What is the biggest motivator for your life?

Folks follow @kenforbes.lens a polyartist - meaning he is mediumless artist, ranging from art, music... I feel that Lens is a great place for Polyartists since you can be a music artist, get collects by publishing music on Lens, but also followers are excited to collect other type of content just as casual posts

Welcome Artboy and super exciting to hear about being Polyartist and bringing out the creativity

Welcome @latasha 🫶

gm to all collectoooors

Interesting idea from Ampleforth team to try to solve couple of points by @vitalik.lens in his posts regarding CPIs:

1. “Can the stablecoin, even in theory, safely wind down to zero users?”

2. “What happens if you try to peg the stablecoin to an index that goes up 20% per year?”

The idea https://blog.ampleforth.org/spot-the-inflation-resistant-store-of-value-87e8112468b2

I haven't read it completely yet  - the mechanics but will comment soon given I have been doing a lot of research recently on inflation

I see identity as a spectrum as well. For example passport and ID card is not identity, rather data points to establish your identity - similarly Ethereum transactioning forms an identity, and Lens compiles a subset identity around profile to profile networking and content sharing/publishing. For example, having Lens, ENS, PoH etc forms a pretty good foundations for new use-cases all together.

You technically can link your ENS to your Lens profile with some sort of an oracle

Follow NFT Collectoooooor

Collected ! what did you use to create it?

Interesting interview - I do believe that its important that policy makers and audiences distinguish the difference between CeFi and DeFi

Why everyone is giving him a platform? : o

@boysclub 🧢representing

Are the Who-to-Follow sidebar recommendations on Lenster getting better for you?

Comment below if you are a new creator on Lens, want to follow and support new creators on Lens 🌿

I think the mainstream looks into crypto from markets perspective - however, the more the web3 infrastructure and use-cases are around non-financial applications, the mainstream media can rely less on the market sentiments.

For comparison the internet was build more first on infromation sharing (webpages) and connectivity (email) while blockchain narrative started from financial use-cases, Bitcoin as securing value transfers between peers, followed by DeFi (financial operating system on Ethereum).

Down the line as we can use blockchain for organising our relationships (social capital), organising more work (DAOs for example) and storing non-financial value (reputation) we will see less focus crypto as markets or finance. Similarly as today we see internet more of an universe.

regarding the ones you tried what kind of features you value the post?

How did you fix it ?

I wonder if there is a musem or something where you could go and play all the old game consoles

I started with 4, but my best memories are with 7 the OG PS

I think its too good character to kill so soon

This was so chill guitar - wish it was longer : )

Love the piano 🎹

Apps build on top of Lens could actually start doing fee sharing with collects - I think there is so much cool things being build on Lens and pretty sure the community and creators would want support the devs 🏗

Been testing Buttrfly app on @LensProtocol - feels very smooth 🦋 if you have a Lens profile you can try the TestFlight https://buttrfly.app

i do lol

Lens is the digital garden where our roots grow 🌿

yeah lol !

Anyone having the same issue in Lenster where you need to re-login all the time?

Binance did some research on web3 social and had a good spotlight on Lens https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/Web3_Social_%20Road_to_Mass_Adoption.pdf

This is going to be the basis of many Lens apps 🔥 amazing work Nader 🚀

DeFi-related insurers currently remind me the first wave of crypto lending platforms in their economic design. Remember when you could lend out Bitcoin to someone who didn't return it back?

welcome 🌿🎵

haha quite accurate what vertical we need?

looks very good 🚀

I am afraid looking how things are we are going towards this direction

Depends on the app, on Lenster behind ... for Butterfly dunno, anoyone knows? 🤔

Thank you @alexkwon.lens 🫶 and welcome to Lens 🌿

Congrats to both of you 👏

Welcome - excited to see some music drops : )

Lens Lists is an app I have been waiting to see being built on Lensverse 🌿 @mixtape.lens list https://lists.inlens.xyz/lists/818595387610071041?share also started to curate the rAAVE list https://lists.inlens.xyz/lists/819895766631940097?share 🪩

Take me back

really love @mixtape

Been thinking a lot inflation lately and how it affects every human on the planet

i agree so much bizarre excitement

haven’t look into crust

but wouldn’t there still be inflation even if we consume less?

interesting point about having enough competition, I do agree that keeps prices tight but for example if the cost of production increases i.e. let say gas price going up it rises all the tides

you mean that people can start innovating on money?

for sure to offset but recession has negative implications as well like layoffs etc

afaik the issue is that if we get rid of FIAT we could have better chances to reduce the inflation? for example if money is pegged to consumer goods

what if the money you are holding does not decrease in value against inflation?

omg lol the math didn’t play out here

Super excited about the acquisition of Sonar 🎉the team is one of the best social media app builders and @south incredible talented designer 🎨 Ben and his team is focusing on building new experiences on Lens Protocol and to empower the whole ecosystem 💚

Anyone using Golem for computation? golem.network

Wondering how is this OG project used

makes totally sense - wondering why isn't working with VPN : o

Interesting didn't know that - wondering why not so reliable. Yeah notifications is the use-case that comes to my mind as well

Everyone used to think few years ago that, well we humans have creativite and DALL-E pretty much took that away from us too lol

3-0 they had such a strong start

This is so nice - collected, also good idea to limit to 10 collects so its rare 🙂

gm that looks like an espresso !

Hilarious

Not really up to date

Now we know

Very true

gm technical folks, have you ever used websockets to interact with the blockchain if so what kind of use-cases its been helpful?

Amazing to wake up and seeing music apps build on top of Lens 🫶

how are the accessories, anything comparable to Ledger’s The Plug?

Looking forward to the app can’t wait to see some ai magic

The #LensList 💚

Lensians, please post more pickies from Art Basel - having a huge FOMO

Very cute!

Wrote a long post today about Aave V3 and wanted to share some thoughts about building DeFi for all the young blood out there to help out 🙌

1) solve an actual problem that has a significant improvement
2) take analogy how your solution is better than the one exists ones
3) design carefully simple BUT sound economics
4) architect the product in a way which aims for simplicity
5) implementation should be clean and simple
6) you built your product, good! now you need to growth hack it!
7) part 6 might take you from 1-5 years

Any other tips feel free below and happy to answer any questions as well. Long live DeFi.

Can't wait to see the outome

New product from Ledger, called The Plug

Someone should research the economy within Lensverse - would be curious to know how many users are collecting other users posts when they receive fees from collects

Now that the @AaveAave Community is preparing for Aave Protocol V3 deployment for Ethereum market 👻 its good time to review why V3 as a flexible architecture is much appreciated 👇🏼

The @AaveAave V3 was deployed earlier this year across various networks including Polygon, Avalanche and L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism as a cross-chain strategy.  For context, Aave V1 was launched on main-net back in January 8, 2020 right before the DeFi summer and accelerated to $1 Billion TVL within 6 months. Bringing also flashloans adoption into DeFi. ⚡️

Aave V2 was new innovation based on predecessor V1 and was launched on December 3, 2020 (exactly 2 years ago) and peaked into $18.5 Billion TVL on October 2021 across multiple markets. 🔥

Post V2 launch, we realized that the stakes in DeFi grew from $0.5 to $180 Billion TVL over these years. This lead our team to focus on various risk mitigation models and similarly the capital efficiency became an important topic within DeFi.

Our work at Aave lead to designing the Aave V3 - where the most exciting feature is actually the flexibility it brings for unlocking decentralized liquidity in both risk averse and capital efficient paths.

  Aave V3 introduced position state management where risk can be siloed by listing assets in Isolation Mode - meaning an asset can be listed with fixed debt ceiling set by the Aave governance and only borrowed against stablecoins, unlocking asset listings for less liquid assets without impacting the main assets. You can still supply other assets to earn but not to use as collateral.

Similarly V3 includes Siloed Borrowing, where an asset can only be listed as a single borrowable asset (without being able to borrow other assets). Extremely useful feature for low liquid assets with manipulatable oracles (i.e. borrowing Uni V3 pairs to hedge 👀).

The flexibility of Aave V3 architecture gives also the ability to enable markets where you can borrow stablecoins and have zero borrowing on your collateral in case you want to store the collateral within the protocol and not being borrowed out.

Other risk management features included introducing Supply Caps and Borrow Caps per asset. Granular Borrowing Power Control also introduce the ability to lower borrowing power of any asset without impacting existing borrowers (better ux) while retaining the flexibility also to use the old V2 method as well.

Aave V3 also introduced the Risk Admins, which enables the governance to delegate permissions to react faster to changed market conditions i.e. between pre-set threshold or automation. Feature that could benefit widely the Risk Council https://governance.aave.com/t/improve-permissions-management-on-aave-v2-and-define-a-better-strategy-for-access-control-roles-on-aave-v3/10802/14

Variable Liquidation Close Factor was also introduce to allow positions to be fully liquidated (vs. partial) which helps liquidators in their liquidation strategies.  Part of Aave’s success story has been the openness from the Aave community to support to be a leader and the first mover for deployments across various networks where transaction fees are lower to bring more users into DeFi, the global, borderless finance.

In 2022, Mainnet V2 received around 150k unique deposits with an average deposit of $550k worth while Polygon V2 2.6 Million, average of $8.5k and Polygon V3 560k with and average of $2k deposit size! We realized that adoption requires the protocol to exist where users are on-boarding to use the blockchain with lower transaction fees.

This led us to focus also on various cross-chain features to empower liquidity movements between various Aave markets between different networks.

One specific feature is the Portal that allows governance to grant an ability (to fixed cap) to burn aTokens on source network (i.e. Ethereum and mint them on the destination network (i.e. Optimism) enabling fast bridging for assets between networks and generating fees for the Aave DAO.

Being L2 ready also led us to introduce Price Oracle Sentinel which introduces a grace period for liquidations and disables borrowing in case a threshold is met, i.e. but not limited to handling the downtime of a sequencer.

V3 introduces the most exciting capital efficiency feature, the High Efficiency Mode (eMode). This new asset category management allows to maximise capital efficiency within the assets that correlate in value in the same category, i.e. borrow one stablecoin against another stablecoin as a category.

eMode also allows to introduce a specific oracle for a certain asset category.

Similarly liquidators and borrowers benefit form the new feature of the ability to repay your position with aTokens.

Credit Delegation was adopted from V2 to V3 - which has interesting potential use-cases especially during low yield environments to allow suppliers to subscribe to a new risk profile without adding risk to the protocol.

Decentralization has been also another focus area. V3 introduces asset listing admins, meaning that in the future various type of asset listing delegations could be added to list new assets (potentially even risk parameters governed by staking AAVE 👀).

Most importantly, releases of the intuitive Aave UI is deployed on IPFS so anyone can truly access the protocol and various previous deployments.

Given that V3 has been successfully deployed and battle-tested across various markets - waiting with full excitement for the new deployment on the Ethereum market and providing users a seamless way to migrate positions between V2 to V3 to benefit from all the new features.

I might have forgot some features (and obviously gas reductions) however, the key takeaway the flexibility V3 as an architecture provides and nothing such would be possible to build without having exceptional people at Aave. For more details head to the docs https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/readme

 Hope this was helpful and insightful while waiting for V3 for Ethereum mainnet 👻

welcome 🌿💚

Really love the idea from @pedromonte for curating lists of Lens real power users, also like how @orbwagmi shows who else commented on the thread 👏

Fam follow @roadwaves.lens for some good rock/soul tunes and 0.99 USD (1 Matic) all the collects

Really love the idea - especially as lot of folks are setting here 1 Matic collects already

I feel there Lens is going to empower lot of musician over the years to come 💚

So so cool whats your tour schedule ?

Thank you for sharing 🫶

This was so so good absolutely a collect! Thank you so much for sharing the song in Lens 💚

congrats 🍾

wow, interesting read on imaginative world. Have to find it

this is my bullish on NFTs face

I mean make sense right, if you can use math to secure scalability vs optimistic, game over

👀

the legendary Lens cube 🌿

Hesburger?

its empowering

This is amazing been waiting couple of years to see the Chainlink infrastructure to adopt staking based security model

Next rAAVE is in Cameroon 🇨🇲

Cameroooooon

I remember this - was in the audience, I think Vitalik said PoS coming in 2024

damn nothing has changed, I remember being 2,5 hours in traffic in Miami

yessss 🔥

love it

👀

haha does this mean a christmas song is dropping soon from Cristina on Lens?

would be interesting to see how it could work with Lens

good ideas?

I feel fomo for Art Basel anything goood going there?

i heard vr boxing is really good for cardio

Given the Apple store's view on NFTs and taking 30% haircut. What are the viable options for non Apple devices?

Welcome - another record label, Anjuna deep style : )

Amazing update! 👏

wow thats a lot would be btw super cool to collect your astrology predictions on Lens 🌌

Happy 1st December

Feeling so honored 🥲

that actually works for me being the driver, the worst are electic cabs which I like but are painful to be in

oh no sounds way worse than my experience hope it gets easier

thats just not gonna work 😂

seriously :o how does it affect?

way easier to explain agree :D

love this

the answer is unknown because we so dont know whats the yellow solo flower

haha love the dance

good idea @yoginth

Level 100k LensFest Level 1 mm LensCity

I totally agree, especially with analog photography the scale of color is enormous

agree that abstracting everything away is vital. Blockchain in the backend, party in the frontend 🎉

🔥🙌

I think starting from the profile portability makes lot of sense since its the most simplest benefit to grasp, and the fact that your followers are not stuck in a platform. Monetization aspect as well is important especially for creators

Love it

Omg hiw did this happen :)

So cool to see the leaderbord ! All my collect revenue goes to collecting more on Lens

🌴

Amazing share followed everyone, education is the path to adoption

Welcome to Lens 💚

So SBF does not have any shame. Goes on every media newspaper and TV to build the "I'm screwed up, I was a nice kid" narrative

How do you explain Lens to your non-crypto frens? 🌿

Correct around 10 am

Nice ! Someday you will have a bigger audience on Lens 😉

lol 😃

I love my Polygon node speed

Coolest part about Lens Protocol is that you don't need an email or a phone number to use social media

Poland Argentina I will predict 0-1 but its hard love both of the teams

It might happen so that lot of web3 social adoption will come from China - people want freedom of speech

I think I have all collects so far : )

GM

totally, something that helps a lot to fight bots is to only allow comments by 2 degrees of friends that pretty much kills them all. Also people shouldn’t follow bots or low quality accounts either

btw if you got to Explore on Lenster there is a trending section as well. Been also thinking how to manage the local language communities. Whats powerful about Lens is that its global so the protocol should serve whole world and apps help to discover the local communities

there is :)

love the idea of boosting user posts

love these features hashtags are already supported and I think what could be cool is to improve the hashtags discovery. For emojis I think we need sticker sets since emojis are supported already

Love the hoodie and will order one ✌️

Do folks get nauseous on a car ride? How not to get nauseous? halp

Bullish on all creators on Lens 🎵

Wish I was there 😢enjoy the week, I was in ETHIndia in 2019 before the DeFi boom and was quite nice to meet so many good devs

Congrats @gotenks.lens you are more power user than me 🚀 incredible how you and @0xzelda.lens @matte.lens @larryscruff.lens @punkess.lens are keeping the community spirit so tight 💚 

my goal is to ensure that more community members are taking my spot as the community grows

Very good pointers totally agree would love to see new notifications highlighted @yoginth.lens @nilesh.lens 

also good idea for LensPort on the hiding posts

DM their details happy to allowlist 🙂

We need this @yoginth.lens 😃

Cool idea !

It's working ! Hopefully all social media apps enable collecting

This is very interesting - for example, the API supports gated content and would be reflected quite soon in the apps like Lenster for example (surely Orb too). You could follow gate or collect gate any content 🔓

Thanks for the positive feedback

Collected your 1 🙌

What I love about Dragaan specifically is the style, the strong voice and funny lyrics. I just feel that if Dragaan keeps pushing out some good songs he will get more recognition. He is a star amongst others stars here in Lens 🫶

Honestly when @dragaan.lens becomes famous my work with Lens Protocol is done and I can fully focus again on DeFi https://lenster.xyz/posts/0xc1bd-0x0175 (collab with @InternetFace.lens )

I had such a busy day that I missed all the matches today ⚽️ 😢 💀

How wide comment reach you have for your posts? Everyone or Frens of Frens, and to what degree?

Would be cool to see mirroring revenue https://lensanalytics.xyz/u/mixtape.lens

Very chill beat 🙏

Really love using canny.io we have it for Lensverse

Shoot your ux feedback for Aave app above 👆

lol this was funny ! Ghostcream

I’m a collectooooor

Definitely agree current copyright laws arent really up to date with the blockchain economy. However one way you could also enforce copyright on-chain if someone is earning from another person’s content whatever means tagt is i.e. NFTs

wow is this your track?

My Argentinian and Mexican frens - are you gonna watch the football match tonight? ⚽️👀

I really like the idea of consumer products that have public good components baked in. Product on the front-end, supporting public goods in the backend. Imagine ChainLink used one way or another as a stack to help support data feeds into the blockchain

Epic defence

Suarez do something 🦷

Uruguay can't really get pass middle field : /

What a miss! South Korea almost scored

What about animals??

I want Korea to win 🇰🇷 v dynamic team

Uruguay - Korea game is lit, why is Son Heung-Min wearing a mask?

This is so cool ! down the line could be used to find people who have similar interests as you and also use these for open algos for content discovery

would love to see aesthetically beautiful experience 🌿

amazing one idea could be that anyone can post songs here and then on Snapshot could create a proposal with all the songs and people could vote with their mixtape follow NFT or profile NFT

It's the people, the community here, you are all incredible ✨

Why stablecoins arent used yet for the basis of internet money? Merchants are getting charged 1-3% for card payments and this all could be easiky avoided. Thoughts?

love it love it looove it 💚

Incredible recipe do you drink also hot filtered coffee? also where you got that gm

something interesting I found out is that I keep
collecting paid content but at the same time earning from mirrors so my balance has been roughly the same :)

I still think the best music was made in the 70s, be gees etc 🪩

Has to be filtered coffee, preferably Columbian or African. I drink around 10-15 cups a day

Elon loves Lens he just don’t know it yet

I vote for this!

What do you want to see being build? LensSpaces having a lead

I've been looking a lot of the work that has been done on the apps across the Lens ecosystem and have to say that never seen anything like this. The developers are pushing code and designers pixels hard to build future of social. If you are building apps on top of Lens, don't hesitate to DM me for feedback on your product or designs. We build together. 💚🌿

I still can't get over the Argentina game : (

Thank you and I think it was a good learning for the community to ensure risk parameters are adjusted ever changing market conditions

Dynamic debt caps might be interesting but the challenge is when you have to scale down as well. However my thinking is that you need to add dynamic parameters to dynamic markets accordingly

Share your ideas and vote to signal to devs what could be built on @LensProtocol https://lensverse.canny.io/ideas 🌿

Huge ! This is why I am bullish on web3 social :D

What is happening with the Argentina - Saudi Arabia game ? : o

lol funny have to collect when back on desktop

Looks amazing !

Best goal so far during World Cup ?

haha this is amazing ! could be definitely part of the Lens giveaways : p bloom bars

Runescape still active?

Welcome @ya7ya.lens to the Lens dev fam 🔥🌿🏗

The world needs more .txt files

I would start by publishing ideas on what you want to build and gather into one place, maybe link to Telegram and invite more folks down the road. Thats how I got started.

Whats rare on @lensport.lens now?

Tervetuloa Kristo! 🌿

This would be epic !

I think you both should get connected !

I think the one I know is @lentilapp.lens by @cordt.lens he is putting effort to learn iOS development just because of Lens 👀

England might be GMI this year ⚽️ first goal!

Nice video and amazing contribution to Lens community

Man you are really good ! Hope more folks will find you on Lens 🫶

Thanks @chriscomrie.lens for the guide into #Lenstopia been explaining to lot of folks how amazing this web3 social story is. Most exciting thing happening now on Lens! Shout out to @cavernaeremita.lens for the inception! 💚

Amazing video. Traditional media is definitely politically opinionated, web3 social provides voice for anyone who is looking to share opinions, which should bring neutrality to news

You are multi-talented based on the instruments you play - very nice genesis drop, collected, will b a nice memory

LOVE it - btw so much large caps lol

Wow so many people left the stadium after half time :O

Adding some tags and categories into the profile claim flow with the help of @wassim.lens & team 🌿 Exciting to see how these would be used as metadata to build better discovery across all Lens apps

haha nice to see Lens being helpful in balancing life :)

open source contributions are for the win

amazing to see that the community does its own spaces with different topics

do it for the yields

crypto.com ads during world cup didn’t see anything on proof of reserves tho

Wouldn't not help I managed to collect the NFT so the match is on-chain now

Who is the all time best football player?

I'll go first: Messi. Great techique, good game reader and speed

I like the idea of using curve for decreasing reputation and increasing stake would be exciting to see this going another way as well where likes of your comments or not getting slashed would decrease the stake amount for next comment. I've seen similar model proposed for emails with condiditional PoW hashcash, I think shared earlier by @vitalik.lens - would love to know if his opinion evolved ever since.

I would btw see one issue that for example if someone's comment I don't like I could burn meaning it might create more bubbles - i.e. dems not commenting on republicans and might segregate content liquidity but with a carefully crafted slasher reputation it could be solved.

Ecuador dominating 🔥

Big fomo for world cup, wondering whats the floor price for tix

Lol the 🟨 card

I would start the collect price as low as 0.1 WMATIC to experiment more and see what people love to collect :)

ah Oxford so nice - we actually gave out the first handles to students in Oxford University who were participating a event we had together with @shefi.lens

I’m ready

gonna be interesting. Let aee how England will be this time

What are those small bottles 👀

I was for sure you would paas the lingo quizz :)

I was reading as So Rare

me ⚽️

all time for sure Metal Gear Solid and Sim City

Its Sunday! Back in my household Sundays were the days when our whole fam participated in a full house clean up. Now join the sweep 🧹 and clean your social graph by unfollowing accounts that do not excite you anymore or are not aligned what you find interesting. ✨

Who is going to follow world cup?

Welcome :)

Contrary to what the public thinks, DeFi has rules. They are just set by the communities and enforced by the smart contracts.

Share your figma on DMs will help

this is the web3 way

interesting, while I do agree that user feedback loops are one of the greatest data points, what if your users don’t have the answers? i.e. there is multiple opinions

This is a hard one. I see value for mixed native/non-native culture but also think there is a need for across team alignment for the web3 ethos even if you are building services/businesses on top of public goods

Interesting, do you feel building a product you should start thinking a solution first? I feel seeing a problem might be helpful.

I think there is more :)

yeah I mean they have tech its more about whether they will be able to build solid use-cases

Interesting weight one StarkNet 👀

Which Zk ecosystem are you following the most actively atm?

This is a hard one

gm

Whats the most hardest part you faced when building products?

full snow here in Helsinki as well, escaping to London now

how can I access?

This would be super cool feature for @xmtp_.lens actually

lensanalytics.xyz shows some good profile stats. Would be interesting to get also engagement rate as well

Follow drabstract.lens for abstract art 🎨

Is this status update a new feature on Lenster or how did you get it @jeanmi.lens ?

With Reflect reflect.withlens.app/

Amazing work and welcome to Lens 💚 collected your Genesis post/art :)

Average earnings per profile that uses monetization on Lens in Matic

Would love to see more "reach" / "curation algos being built on Lens  - anyone working on this?

Hello Mars

Interesting writing about proof of solvency, ideas on how CEXes could add measures not being able to steal the users balances https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/11/19/proof_of_solvency.html

I had to collect this but good example the challenges with the server/federated model. I think what works better is actually shared state of data availability. I see challenges more in when hosts are shutting down servers if they don’t want to continue and a community is lost. Would like to hear @vitalik.lens thoughts

haha this was amazing thank you 🙏

gm feeling like a lazy Saturday ☁️

Sorare has been getting lot of traction lately

on-chain life

looks cool did you design it?

would be cool

Who would you love to see on Lens? ✨🪄

sounds like useful, I personally hate when financial magazines have a link to the stock prices, it makes everything too financial

how would CL be useful? verification of data?

just ate also its nice to see some snow

gm @cordt.lens its nice you have been progressing on Lentil. Love focus on curation and might be something you should share with @vitalik.lens as he is exploring web3 social atm

this was so funny lol

the baby swag looks great 👍

gm 🍟

rip 💀

The best way to get grey hair is to build a DeFi protocol

Congrats! been following the progress of Alchemy for a while and been blown away how much you all progressing. Hope to visit the new office soon

After playing some Padel, was thinking that would be cool to get my padel scores on chain to demonstrate my ranking. Blockchain seems like a good way to store bragging rights. Same for gaming like progress in Fortnite etc

What are some interesting use-cases for using Chainlink with Lens Protocol?

nan

Slush after after party

yes

Hullo back 🌿you now own your social profile and the connections you make. Enjoy 💚

this

good scale to start with

Pop quizz whats the proper sauna temperature one should aim for?

I met so many folks in Slush who are thinking of their web3 strategy who are outside of web3. AI, Gaming, Consumer and Fashion. Feels like bear market does not exist here 🚀

Big TY 2 Hannah (Bloomberg news) for the insightful questions about web3 social and @lensprotocol 🌿Exciting things to come! @slushHQ #web3

gm to everyone who woke up today

Slush day 2 gm

See you all soon 💚

Been in Slush the week - will catch up with my Lenster DMs over the weekend : )

Nothing is a good as morning sauna - thank you @wagmi.lens & @jouni.lens for the steams 👌

What I learned about building web3 products over the years is to build your products to be as composable and unopinionated as possible. Web3 benefits from permissionless endpoints - being able to obtain adoption depends on how much room you leave for others to solve

Relevant issue for today. Remember when MySpace lost its all user content data? https://mashable.com/article/myspace-data-loss

That is why data availability layers are going to be important - and not to rely on centralized platforms to store data

Welcome and big fan of CL community 🫡

Feels amazing to see DJs that played in rAAVE to drop exclusive music on Lens. This is a major appreciation to our community 💚If you’re an artist drop your creativity on Lens, people want to collect it 🌿

This is on my auto repeat now

Finland, living now in UK. How did you end up in Helsinki?

now Ben Böhmer, the legend

This guy is legit

warm up before Ben Böhmer

ETH the sound money

How many POAPs you have?

Lens fam if you are around tomorrow at Slush come to see my talk on Founders Stage at 4 pm - will share some interesting progress on Lens 🌿💚

Welcome !

gm back here if you are a creator : )

I mean as a tech Zk really solves scalability by math so that really is competitive advantage - Optimistic rollups have been good tho to offload the load from Ethereum into rollups but nothing stops rollups converting into zk ones down the line

Lets make this happen 💚

Omg this is huge, going to collect when back on desktop, exclusive track from rAAVE DJ 🥰

gm everyone who is on web3 social 💚

Word 🌿🌿🌿

POAP 🫶

gm back

Slush booth at Slush 💚 Converting techies into web3 social

Founders stage with Revolut founder giving tips on scaling

Would be actually cool if you take your non crypto friends as well and they could mint their profiles on spot 👀

I cut my own wood too 🪵

Gm ☕️

i think more earned status would make sense vs pay to flex

DM me :)

We need also Lens kicks 👟

Also good representation in London :)

very cool 🚀

This was good !

Was an interesting to hear this - we need similar declaration for web3

This was good, thanks for dropping 🫳🏼

I use it all the time, honestly I've been helping the team with QA for almost two years with my transactions and getting into good shape now :)

It's a veggie market

Playstation or Xbox?

Android or iOS?

Found the one and only goat @wagmi.lens 🐐

You might be wondering my recent Lens posts. I am demonstrating to people at Slush how easy it is to use apps build on top of Lens. WAGMI

I love Lens 💚

Terve

I love cheese 🧀

Gm 🫶🌿🌿

Incredible update from the Lens backend team ! 👏

Something that I did a lot during my early entering into web3, I was talking to lot of folks in groups, learned a lot and shared ideas. I still feel thats the best way to learn. Feel less restricted on sharing your ideas and open yourself for feedback - thats how you get further in your learning curve. For all learnoooors

Seeing lot of creators here recently I think @christina.lens and @bradorbradley.lens are up to smthg 👀

While last week was insane, there are folks that are fundraising and also pushing products out, congrats to ZkSync team https://www.theblock.co/post/187503/matter-labs-raises-200-million-to-boost-zksync-adoption-and-grow-its-team

thats the hour for creativity and research so might not be a bad habit after all 😅

Who are the "power users" on Lens that you would like people to follow?

Helsinki is cold af

Who'se gonna build the Lens powered Discourse? 👀

I think hopping between apps is great for the beginning as many of the apps are starting to form their own algos down the line and create more discovery tools

gm Helsinki

whats the light in the background?

cost control always important

interesting what comes to my kind is remix culture

Would LensTube need a mobile app?

deep

damn in do remember geocities i think my first website was on it 🫡

its a game changer people have better taste on memes here

incredible how creative folks can become with ai art

you should come to London for some fish n chips

this is very sick ! 🪩

beautiful 🥲

interesting what are typical use cases or appearances for this concept?

Governance ✊

simple and sweet

lool too funny

bytes are the best 🫶

This view has become iconic. I am trying to collect the ones with rare shades of the skyline

full hussle here 🌿

i have the same seed amazing lels

This is cool - you can only collect if you're the follower of the curator who is @mixtape.lens in this case

Congrats for all the followings 👏 you deserve it also I've been collecting all your music. Wondering if I could create a playlist out of it and listen during fireplace nights

Based on Charlie's logic, whole finance should be banned and no one should be touching any bank. Well there are banks that are trusted but there are also DeFi protocols that work despite of what is happening on markets https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/charlie-munger-says-crypto-is-a-bad-combo-of-fraud-and-delusion-good-for-kidnappers.html

Epic!

Love the new @lenstubexyz.lens redesign - mix between YouTube and TikTok 🎥📲 Amazing progress @sasicodes.lens  🌿 👏

The thing is you can make DeFi quite close to perfect

haha yeah maybe we need to fix that by now on the app @yoginth.lens

gm to everyone here who wakeups up to share something interesting with the community ☕️

Very beautiful fits into my autumn 🍂

I love this! Food and music is all that keeps us moving :)

Welcome 🌿

our next update will be so that you can move your profile and followers all together to make it smoother

Congrats 👏

i usually collect post by buying the NFT not rights or what so ever, those should belong to the creator or CC0

I have a collectors opinion, being collecting NFTs for the past couple of years that I prefer to collect novel content on Lens or even posts where maybe there is some additional context. Lens is great imo to drop content directly to your followers/community thats quite epic to me

wow do you use those background visuals while you code?

Welcome to Lens 🌿

Reminds me of the northern lights

lets make it interesting, i think it will happen within 30 days

Wow @mikeshinoda.lens genesis post has sparked amazing vibes ✨✨✨✨

I own this incredible writing now

I keep collecting content that I like and my MATIC balance wasn't decreasing, figured out that I have been earning form Mirroring lol. Healthy circulation 🌳

I love that you can adjust the settings

Haha this was funny - Ronnie the rAAVE Ghost 👻🪩

Honestly one of the best advices seen here in Lens. Follow people you really are interested, read more and talk to people, especially now with DMs in Lenster, its easy!

Welcome 💚

Who are the people to follow for Fashion NFT scene in Lens? Just on-boarded @edalouparis.lens also f3manifesto.lens digitalax.lens elajtasarim.lens

Going to @lensport.lens to find some gems, brb

Welcome to Lens fam 🌿 will be following closely for some fashion NFT takes : )

Welcome !

gm gm Bob!

Epic song - was on my background while working - sure @davidev.lens might like this one

Must be a glitch

No but I like that

lol well done !

omg I think its even darker in Reukjavik - I would say that keep lights on where ever you are - because its quite dark outside and try to be out when the light is out : )

well the summers are all night bright : )

Phaver folks are here and also Slush.org

Obivously its around 6 pm but still exciting darkness : )

Really love how permissionlessly everyone is joining in to contribute

So cool thanks for the update !

What was your recent paid collect you collected? 👀

Congrats! 👏 excited to be an owner of your follow NFT

Welcome 🌿

The portability is such a strong concept in Lens since you don't really need to re-create your accounts and also you "carry" your followerbase across all the apps and the apps can also choose what to curate (i.e. only your music content). Technically all web2 social platforms could come up and agree upon doing something like this even without web3 and set some standards in a distributed ledger or trust-based system but they have more incentives to protect their platforms and ad revenues

Best way to avoid FTX news 🌴

gm!

love it

Can someone make a post on all things happening in #Lenstopia seems like lot of progress ✨

Helsinki at noon

lol the state of crypto

Guess what this non-alcoholic drink is

Amazing to see you're continuing to develop the project!

Amazing - bring your friends into Lens is the way to spread roots 🌱

Wow just collected @mikeshinoda.lens genesis post on Lens. AMA.

Hello fren - welcome to our digital garden 🌿

Orb, Phaver and On-board

Wow - always wanted to hike over Himalayan Range, lucky you, especially witnessing the sunrise

I love wooden architecture

Insane view - Iceland is top on my go to list

Liberty for all

Interesting background story thanks for sharing - looks very cool

Love the dark color here, will look up the band as well thanks for sharing

I love this idea so anything you collect you become a DAO member of that particular content - v cool to see evolve even into having DAO treasuries and improve the Nouns model

Very cool to read the descriptions - thanks for sharing, collected as well 🫶

This is incredible

Looks interesting, I like the fact that its on-going work

Post below the best picture you ever took with some backstory👇

Landing to Helsinki! Who'se in town next week?

Can't believe that all these folks that are running centralized exchanges are giving tips on how to secure your funds - by using a centralized exchange, without mentioning a word about DeFi

Can I get an access to Lentil or is it still full stealth? 👀

There is one for Share to Lens that could be generally used but would love to see more app specific sharing buttons used outside of web3. Apparently I am not the only one who is thinking about Lens during a shower 🧼

Congrats! this is absolutely incredible achievement can’t believe how quickly things evolve. There are so many good ones that makes me laugh my ass off lol

for the latter means that its a time race to figure out your future

Finnish reindeer 👀

I’ve been scrolling my Lens feed and impressive how much the community and the content has evolved! You are what makes Lens 💚DM me if you have a good friend we could invite to Lens Protocol and describe the reason why. Lets spread our roots 🌿

omg good luck and ens name is definitely useful not as green as lend handle but worth to have ;)

Cool did you make them yourself?

gm

lol this is me in uni, eventually led me into founding ETHLend from my dormroom

really love this idea would love to see if anyone takes an initiative to build since it could be very cool to explore

looks very cool where is this?

I guess gate.io kept a bounty lol

LensCart gmeowww

also lot of rules can be already baked into smart contracts and thats powerful

valuable feedback 💚

Folks still working on my song trying to drop tomorrow

mmmmmmmmm

Love it!

Thanks for the share fam! collected

gm

Testing *this* composer and it looks **gmi** to me

`This is my code - feel free to copy pasta it`

Where is underline? 👀

This is going to age well 🍷

Found a Lens heart near Notting Hill, Saturday afternoon. Autumn brings darkness, green heart brings joy 💚

100k profiles minted on Lens 🥳

Super cooool when is the next one ?

Love the quality of the camera

Also internet had quite lot of challenges over the decades, part of the transformation and learnings

iykyk

Lol would be definitely good but do you know that @ivnersebrah is build in as default already in Lens ;)

DM me

it think couls be valuable for peer reviews!

Noted lol

This was so good, loved the dancing on the road : )

Collected to support more of these good drops - I feel we will have to have a LensFest soon :)

Anyone going to Slush next week? Thats the event I discovered blockchain first time

Good questions

1) most of the bots have been previously lurking on comments but now with the "friends and their friends and their..." comment module, they are mostly gone. Then of course you won't see bots unless you follow them, right?

2) CultivatorDAO is one content moderation tool but would like to see more community initiatives and powerusers to participate

3) Would like to see content policies driven by different apps especially as these apps will grow like Lenster, Orb and Phaver

4) I like the idea of content moderation lists! Would love to see it being evolved

Looks cool what did you use to create this?

feeling exactly the same - whats the most interesting thing you've been seeing?

gm!

Question for those living in NYC - what are the best areas to stay?

Good rule of thumb has been last week of November but recently I've heard xmas jingles as early as beginning of November so I think its safe yes ! 🎄

Incredible growth this is really fascinating to watch thanks Ricky for pulling the data together

My TW feed is full of FTX. My Lens feed is full of music, art, interesting non crypto, some interesting crypto as well. We are not the same.

I’m going to work on a new song to drop on Lens tomorrow 👀

interesting so YT premium is good for music :o

I love your art :)

would be cool go get also the scoll to count @yoginth.lens

lol yes

If anyone sees Aave/Lens smart contract team going wild tonight in London, I don’t take any responsibility 🙉🙈

Very tempting 👀

wow 255 so far this is lit 🔥

If we would do a Lens meetup in London, how many of you would come? Collect this to signal your interest in attending

gmmm

gm Friday ✨

interesting so the idea is to manually create section where you could submit profiles that you know post on specific content like DeFi or NFTs?

and down the line adding tags? and if there is enough similar tags there posts would eventually end up in those categories

This feels very good idea epsecially if you could create categories. One question I have is that how the content of DeFi ends there in that group?

What are the best tips for scrum?

Paid collects enables this or even could see an API that has an endpoint to plant a tree 👀

All DMs in Lenster 🌸 are End-to-End Encrypted thanks to @xmtp_.lens 🔐

Was also thinking group DMs? or communities type of a feature that works cc @yoginth.lens

too early

keep em coming

looks so cool

welcome players

Would be cool to do Lens meetup in Helsinki some time soon - lot of users here actually 🇬🇧

Need to DM me 👀

@yoginth.lens did a brave move - this means he is a Chad!

Congrats @yoginth.lens for the brave move! Open source is the way to go! 👏

Suuuuuper good question. I would say A!

Friday's are the fries 🍟 days for me now - will share mine

Anyone here was in Burning Man this year? How was it? Considering to go next year

I couldn't imagine FTX meltdown being a big issue as I haven't used centralized exchanges for almost 2 years since DeFi became easier to use. Would not actually even compare FTX to Mt. Gox since DeFi didn't exist back then as a safety net and Mt. Gox had 70% of the volumes

@yoginth.lens simply just shippooors 🚢

Amazing! and down the line could have a historic graph 🔥

https://memester.xyz/ @memester.lens looks great and best part is that there's gonna be some meme competitions 👀

I have been collecting NFTs since pretty much OpenSea became live but I am way more excited about Music NFTs as they make most sense to me as a vinyl record collector. You get a digital good that is signed and verified. It's the future of music monetization 🎵

Cute sushi ghost 👻

Looks very sick is this metaverse gallery?

Lol this is funny af

kind of the same lol

what is this? 👀

She’s a 10 but she can’t withdraw from FTX

I don’t see it either but sounds exactly what would help to track metrics 👀

Everyone off to prediction markets https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/09/binance-is-strongly-leaning-toward-scrapping-ftx-rescue-takeover-after-first-glance-at-books-source/

Gm to everyone who has the ownership of thei social media profile 🌿🔑

Really hope people will learn more about DeFi and why its important. Centralized exchanges require trust where yesterday that trust was lost. Share the best resources below to learn about DeFi 👇🏼

Nintendo and ofc super mario, but the console I really grew up with was PS1 ! Especially games like crash bandicoot and FIFA ⚽️ and of course Tomb Raider

Asl the issues with centralized exchanges are proving how much we need DeFi

Welcome ! 🌿

I've been always thinking what kind of setup you have in ableton and this picture of the track making says more than a thousand words

an incredble audience and amazing guests 🫶

👀

Congrats 🥳

I think because its paid collect and App Store is a blocker

Lmao too funny had to collect

Toronto could be cool ! what could also interesting of people can start hosting meetups around the world and ask fro grants to get venue and some food and beverages, thats grass roots 🌿

My diet is going well day 2

You can! You probably have gold mine of knowledge around ticketing and events

I think the issue is when you don't restrict the comments to people you follow and they follow (setting it to 2-3 would fix lot of the issues).

Amazing update - this helps to get insights of the profile before looking further, thank you for the feature! 🙏

Maybe we could use this for the next rAAVE https://github.com/ArturVargas/ticklens.js

Who wants to build ticketing app on top of Lens? 👀

The future of social media is decentralized.

Goo time to do CZ memes rememe.lol

haha need to do that more often

Two months of excitement left lol

So Binance just bought FTX

I have three invites to Orb DM for access first come first served :)

Congrats on your first post very cool! I am a big fan of voxels so nice to see some footage :)

Lisbon?

Anyone been in an algorave?

Was your first super follower : ) looking for the perks ;)

Welcome! 🌿

gm!

Collected to support your first 🫳🏼

Whats the best Lens native meme template you've seen so far?

My takeaways from the Lens genesis community call 🌿🤙

- Lens community is forming
- There are lot of users who are here because they believe in decentralization
- Composability is the key, XMTP integration demonstrated it
- Lenster could become a front-end for integrations that serve the users
- Lens Protocol is build also creators in mind
- We're all here for the memes as well
- Feeling optimistic

Thank you all for attending and we truly have an exciting community 💚

Hey fam follow @sophiest.lens she does nice short bytes on @lenstube.lens and got activated recently 🫶 also @chriscomrie.lens is a legend already in LensTube follow as well 🔥

Very good explanation of Network States

I see lot of people in the line to get in especially in the summer in Soho London

Welcome! LensTube is great for sharing knowledge and insights much appreciated and also the short form as well is great !

This is gonna be lit!

Fomoing for a pin!

Welcome Meltem to Lens 🌿

@ethglobal.lens 💚

Good vibes love it and welcome to Lens Protocol @boysnoize.lens can't believe that you played in the first rAAVE 🫶

Me! Who else? 👀

I would say by learning, we learn whats good and bad and sometimes through worst experiences but the good part is that we can teach others to avoid doing same mistakes over again

Grass? 🌿

Heard someone is building LensSpaces 👀

LFGhörli 🏃🏻👻

Super excited about the genesis community call! Welcome all to tune in to hear latest development updates and community updates 🌿

Good explanation on the recent JPM trade with Aave Arc fork https://open.spotify.com/episode/2UVQAjMPg7fkvqVCuNPYfP?si=wXe7NpJmRKmBLCIt2u2Dwg&nd=1

welcome 🌿🌿

ser what does the product do?

I manifested a new diet this morning. Lean meat for a while, extra low carbs. Ghoing to get fit

so excited, Katya is doing lot of work on DeFi side with Aave can’t wait to meet first time IRL

I agree that the path should be to buils things that are novel and unique

gm ✨

Welcome and incredible to see you here have seen some amount of sound.xyz shares here 🌿🎵

delish

welcome 🌿

have to say it was very good :)

Follow closely @lenstopia.lens getting Loot vibes and its evolving into a story and characters, very exciting ✨

super smart setting 1/1 missed as well but very curious how these characters will evolve. I feel like this is the first Loot type of an adventure within of Lens

What will Solana folks sell?

💯 I buy music NFTs to support an artist, end of the day thats what matters and keeps the beat going

gm 🌿

Hey all follow @marcus.lens he actually loves Lens Protocol so much that he deleted the bird app lol

Nice entry story into crypto :)

Does it come with NFT support or you had to do something to support?

I'm really happy how UK is progressing on tech and web3. Access to be heard on policy, gov is getting friendlier on crypto, easy to get visas now, the food is good & lot of new restaurants opening, music scene is great. Easy to fly anywhere. Bullish.

totally, I think Verifiable Credentials could have some interesting use-case like verifying different things and even packaging them together to validate access

Wow where is this? The 🗻 is incredible

Many things, also I do agree some people can pay that 8 bucks but also it changes the idea of verifications, not its pay to play

gm and welcome to Lens 🌿

Welcome 🚀

Patiently waiting 👀

Congrats! 🥳

Thanks for coming to the gathering was super fun and exciting to hear your story 💚

Just DMed you ser :)

For You is a curated list that is updated on-going basis, Popular is based on activity metrics such as likes and collects. Trending is based on whats getting traction and interesting is based more on sharing (mirror).

If there is an algo you or anyone wants to experiment we're happy to experiment :)

Have that happen, hope this helps https://peppershomeandgarden.com/how-find-cricket-house/ 🦗

I missed this but congrats!

gm

Giving some exposure :)

Gm world!

First time ever hearing dnb with indian instruments so cool

Welcome! 😎

Welcome! 🌿

maybe good way to resolve if @notgonnamakeit.lens mints a collectible fun post which the OP can collect 💚

very good point agree

Fish n Chips the London way 👌

Love the top and bottom menu of @orbwagmi.lens great work @nilesh.lens & team getting slight Tumblr vibes 🤙🏼

I could see value in being able to tip someone who gives a presentation

Interesting thanks fror the share :)

I am currently allowlisting Seb :)

Welcome!

Lol so funny

I would say Lensta built by @arturs.lens

Nice - I didn't know you make music, feels quite dynamic, like it :)

Nice thanks for sharing exclusively on Lens, Chad move!

Welcome 🌿

loool

I even believe that the smallest ones are the ones who benefit the most as you don't need to necessarily focus on getting large audience and you have your small niche of followers who value your creativity

gm music fam, where I can get nice LoFi vinyl records? Preferrably in London 

I am getting more and more addicted to LoFi

Have you met anyone from our team IRL? 👀

Welcome! 🌿

Having hard fomo : )

Well done we have to share that bottle, save me a drip

Had to collect lol

I feel Lens is authentic, community driven and open place to hang and discuss & share. Every day I feel that there are more active community members, I don't even see people here as users, they are community members 💚

Love this idea! @xinobi.lens

Smol @lenster.lens alpha leak 👀

Welcome 💚

Preach DeFiDad thats the way to get folks to care 💚

I agee that nothing is as good as being early adopter of a network

kind of both, but mainly interested

Welcome!

So happy that they look nice :)

LensFest 👀

Welcome 🌿

Welcome!

This is epic, nice way to celebrate Mike Shinoda joining into Lens !

I think I am going to join you on this one now haha

Would definitely like to try it !

Can we get some predictions 🙏🌌

Inception upon main-net

Amazing idea and would love to try and pay for a good pfp!

So cool would love to see someone wearing these on a CryptoCoven NFT

Love the occasional meme spikes. Post your meme with rememe.lol or memester.xyz 😎

gm !

Why Cardano, nothing really happens there : o

what did you write

Engagement is actually gone up, I think mainly because a community around Lenster is starting to form

gm! 🌿

Epic song - super excited to collect your music !

SO beautiful - I can't wait to come back to BA had so much fun and learned so much about Argentina 🇦🇷

gm 👀

hold my beer

👀

Aren't you scared of doing that? Would imagine these alligators just snapping : D

Would love some swag

Very good recipe Zoe, never tried banana bread with hazelnut ☺️ I wonder also prob the calories are low on banana bread in general

rekkt

Wondering if someone could create post module with a chess game some could just drop a chess game and invite someone to play

Queen to C4 for now

lol I thought it was a king not a queen.

Tower to F8 ?? halp

Reminds me a lot of Finland 🇫🇮

Cool that @orbwagmi.lens allows to share knowledge area on Lens profile. Could imagine this evolving into peer verified zk badges with @sismo.lens

its on testflight but its very early, Im sure the Lensta folks can give access at some point arturs.lens

This chad keeps on growing 🌿

Anyone here who plays Padel? 🎾

i guess the learning is that we could do better and improve the existing

I agree that intentions were to build businesses which brought lot of efficiency and also agree they were early. I do recall that ideally internet was build on the idea of decentralization but it took a bit of a turn

@creators.lens ✨📸🎵🎥🎨🖌

My latest fascination has been the observation that users in Lens are focusing on building relationships instead of being transactional. At yesterdays get together one attendee mentioned that because of the DMs he could now continue discussions with people he met on Lens and met some of them IRL. Its an open world 🌎 here 🌱

My mobile setup is Orb connected to Metamask mobile thats connected to my web metamask.

Congrats 🎉

Punk 👀

Growing up on internet I witnessed web going from explore and read to create, connect and share. It was so efficient disruption that it made almost every online user into a social media user. As a consequence the internet was built and owned by few companies, the big tech. Social media users are now feeding the platforms with data, social capital and identity. They are the reason these platforms grew into existence. This created unfair dynamics between the users and the platforms. Users do not have a say how the platforms should be operated, which has lead into unhealthy and unfair internet. We all need our own self sovereign social media. A network which gives the power back to the users. The users are the owners of their social capital. No one should be able to take that away from you. You own your voice.

looks sick

Lens liberates

ngl i feel it too

how does it get stuck exactly? might yes network issues

haha sounds about right lol

Lensta mobile app has a feature to curate your feed based on what you like by swiping. Very interesting way to follow things you like the most. Testing the alpha 👀

How does it feel to be owner of your social ?

Which one you will challenge for a wrestle

We're about to democratize checkmarks

This man knows where the value is!

Amazing stuff @sasicodes.lens 🥳

Few!

Very dynamic drums!

Lens Profiles are trending on OpenSea 👀

Whats should we do ? : o

Folks got the location for the Lens meetup tonight in Lisbon  9 pm. Shoot me a DM for details 🌿

Lens fam, we will have a spontaneous meetup at 9 pm today in Lisbon 🚀 stay tuned for the location 👀

Crypto track at WebSummit is completely packed on all talks

will DM

Optimistic API would mean that all the actions are reflected instantly and blockchain transactions are settled in the background. This will be implemented across all actions and will turn the web3 experience to something we are very used to across online apps, guaranteed by the blockchain

Cool to see now that you can buy the NFT on @lensport.lens if its collected already on Lenster. Very good update @yoginth.lens 👏

First of all amazing work that you have done on building the first front-end client for Lens Protocol and amazing community around it. 💚 My question is that what makes you come back and contribute all the time? Secondly, what could be exciting ways to increase retention? Third what is the mobile app plans? 👀🙏

Low it so you comment #bookmarkAlensΞ and becomes a bookmark?

This is beautiful, the three copies went fast so need to hunt mine from @lensport.lens

Gm 💚

gm pancake fam

Gm Lensters, anyone want to meet at 8 pm today for mini-meetup in Lisbon?

gm

We love them all 🫶

Genious, this was the reason why they shippoored DMs so quickly

Explaining zk scalability and privacy would be good doing it in the simple way is much needed. The rollups, validators, staking :)

Or for a good 🍔?

@xinobi.lens are you in Lisbon? Lets DM

Proof of Culture. Great swag @gotenks.lens

dope swag 🌿🫶

Would you pay $8 for my memes?

This is so cool, steganography (if I spelled it correctly) where you hide your message into content. Interesting to see it in melody notes, never knew. Wonder what could be Lens post equivalent, probably hiding into the metadata 🤔

you can follow more but you means that you need to pay the gas, so its a rate limit to avoid bots :)

gm

Welcome 🌿🌿

We are about to hack something very cool on Lens Protocol during the next few days with @habibi.lens @ya7ya.lens @anastacio.lens 👀

Love the music embeds on Orb looks nice

Nice track, I think could be developed into many paths, I really want to remix this maybe with StemsDAO . Also I like the fact that you put only 5 collects, gonna be rare

dm dm

Follow my boi @michaeldudas.lens

gm gm ser

Everyone is organising their La Degens plans via Lenster DMs atm now lol

DMs are live on Lenster 🥳 DM me with your cheesiest one liner 🧀

Whats happening here 👀

Guess who I met the legend @sandeep.lens at WebSummit

get in ma belli

Growth between apps on Lens, iconic collect

Very cool, nice to see the amount of posts at that high amount already

done

Thanks amazing feels good to know there is fellow Lens users in the crowd 🌿💚

Thanks for the recommendation 👌

gm Sam

Got hungry and collected some 🍟

Noticed that my average time to eat lunch is 3.5 minutes

Well done! My recommendation is always to set small fee for collects and limited to 10-25 copies 👀

Landed to Lisbon where is everyone 👀

4:30 am wake up - feeling great

We need more courses on Orb learn 🤓

its all coming together

Lets all meet

omg so cool 🤩

gmm

Super excited to see how the new algo works 👀

Product people, whats the hardest part in building a product? What are the typical challenges and how did you overcome? I want to hear your product journeys

This feature is going to be powerful, some of the challenges for me currently is to keep up with all the snapshots and seeing them directly on Lens feed would solve it

Go for Art and Music

Interesting what are these? Part of a game?

yes will be around the websummit would be cool to meet with the Lens community members

This was so good 🫶

Who is in Lisbon tomorrow and day after? Will be in town and would be cool to hang with Lens fam?

I would not recommend to remove collects on posts because I think they can become quite important user generated content

Yess would be cool to get the apps to save an image of the text it would be nice, pushing it

Are you in Lisbon tomorrow Mark? Lets meet 😎

Thats very cool I hope more folks will use it, looks quite nice in motion

omg that sounds terrible hope you are recover 💚

Well done :)

75 bps was expected but also need to raise down the line more to keep the inflation in order

Welcome to Lens 🌿

wow how did you make it move like that?

This was a must collect me but wondering why not set the price to 8 USD worth of wmatic

I disagree, I want to get every girl and boy I talk, to mint a Lens profile 🌿

Follow JPM goat tylobban.lens for successful Aave Arc & JPM live transaction 🔥

nan

Memster looks to be live 🔥 More options to ship memes on Lens https://memester.xyz/

Yes this is actually coming also you can do limited by amounts and limite by time together 👀

Good amount of 🌶

Mobile adoption of Lens Protocol is becoming popular. Green is Phaver 🦄 and next to it red is Orb 🪐 might be the other way around as I am color blind

gm from London ☕️🫖

omg haha yes! Incredible idea from @paris.lens to had them made for DevCon

Funny enough I’ve never been into Crypto events in Brussels but will be definitely on my to do list

Would love to hear how people found Lens and what they like about it the most 🌿

lol

Wow that person gets it 🥲

I wonder whats the most used emojis atm on Lens 🤔

Omg this is a byte that I will use over and over again, thank you so much for making it 💚

Hey all follow @iamkabuki.lens he makes some nice music 🎵

Welcome to the fam 🌿

Anyone want to go to a halloween party today?

This is why I love the Lens community

My first post from Onboard 🛹

gm 🌿

I think its from Jamaica actually

It feels like more of a veal tbh

This is a hard call, I would say its a tie

Goat in curry

yes ok

No this time 🍟 would have been good with fries

very cool, all messagign E2E encrypted?

I ate curry goat 🐐AMA.

so good, need more covers on-chain :)

gm 🌅

Imagine verification badges but you actually own it as a soul-bound token, no one can take away after issuing it

Feeling good about 🪐

The way to manage checkmarks is by allowing to create verification communities to create their own checkmarks. People who care about them will request one, others who care to pay will do so for a common treasury. Would love to see a Nouns DAO that focuses on giving checkmarks

There is an increasing need for fully homomorphic encryption as data becomes bigger liability https://cybernews.com/security/thomson-reuters-leaked-terabytes-sensitive-data/

👀

Don't forget to celebrate achieving your goals

yes have web3 native approach all the way from the ground up. Imagine the possibilities

My feed is full of Orb, nice to see Lens users getting excited abput mobile first experiences, same for Phaver 🙌

yes need to download Orb

Looking at the Apple’s agressive app store policies, the only way to win is by building hardware that focuses on access for web3

Seedclub

lol

yes and something like the change of the color would be very neat way to message to the user that its time to rest :)

I agree, lets plant the seeds

Lensfluencooor

Very neat feature request! @yoginth.lens

Public goods might be hard to buy, it would just not work without community governance and coordination

gm and welcome!

Amazing activity on Aave governance 🗳

Quite fun, would the idea to signal the user how much time is spent on social?

Welcome to the Lens fam! 💚

Welcome to your digital garden 🌿

Welcome back and thanks for reporting the issue 🙏

The inflation numbers aren't looking good, as we know inflation is tied quite directly to monetary policies and main cause of the increasing consumer prices

Seeing @mikeshinoda.lens updating pfp and cover like a legend. No posts, yet but I've set my Lensbot on alarm. My gut feeling tells me its going to be a song 👀

@ch1rag.lens have you considered your top collectors filtered by all and paid to the profile page of LensAnalytics?

I have seen tho some progress on more sustainable fashion for a while now, hopefully we see the trend continuing

afaik I think fashion industry is the second or third most polluting industry depending how you run the numbers.

👀

Any folks here in DeFi, have a question for you. Have you considered ever whether something like inflation could be solved by using blockchain and what kind of benefits? Mainly thinking economical experimentations that could be run in silo on-chain to see how it would work.

Hip hop needs a bit of a movement to succeed - maybe some kind of studio jamming sessions between few folks that focus on the web3 native audience. Web3 is perfect for hip hop, there is the lingo, the mems and only rhymes are missing

gm Rosie 🐶

Anyone interested in Investment DAOs, recommend to connect with @iandaos.lens who is building SyndicateDAO which actually has investment & social components

*is lol

InLens if a great discovery tool to match with folks from CT https://inlens.xyz/ try it out Ian

DM me in TW (soon we can DM on Lenster) I have a spare access code for Orb

Well said, also whats Chainjet 👀

Followed you as well to get some alpha, amazing interview of Marc Zeller btw

Congrats on your 1k followers 👏 🥳 love the creativity on the anti-bot feature :)

Hey @juancito.lens something cool you could add into InLens is a follower game. A simple follower game could be where you and your friends follow users in Lens and whoever gets the same result let say out of 10 follows (or more) will earn points 🏆

You could try @orbapp.lens or @phaver.lens

InLens is a great tool for twitter frens discovery on Lens https://inlens.xyz/ find if any of your new frens from twitter are in Lens 👀🌿

insane setup. Whats the instrument at 00:48?

This was suuuuuper good, and some interesting alpha on DAOs

very cool !

Too good ▫️

Imo would set 10-25 limited collects. Would keep at 10 for a while, and set 0.1 WMATIC or less as collect fee for small content and see how the content will get traction later on @lensport.lens for secondary fees

Love the story experimentation, I feel there is a need for story form app for Lens Protocol, really liked the ending :)

yes definitely good to have options just wondering how they guarantee what they promise, thats the issue always with the privacy preserving tools, unless they are cryptographically guaranteed

Amazing find, I do not know exactly what either Infura or Alchemy collects as data but do like the privacy perspective. Any idea how they preserve privacy? by just promising not to collect data?

I think we need more community driven checkmarks. Could be cool to spin out small DAOs like CultivatorDAO to give badges

Alienware is the way to go

So here is the thing, I am a Apple users and not that really tied emotionally into Apple given how much competitive and better products there are on the market. I am tied to all the services like icloud etc, that would definitely take some work to migrate. To the point, I think the way to bypass the whole App store issue is to have a hardware that really is to experience web3 ground up. Including also OS that is tailored to create web3 accessibility.

Yes could be very cool even to let the community/followers to manage that treasury and the creator could do request to fund activity like producing new content. Could be cool as experimentational idea

yesss : )

Follow @boysclub.lens ✨

Are those pokemon cards?

Love the various perks for Super follow. I really like the idea of super follow, especially if the fee is set very low (even under 1 WMATIC). This one is from @internetfase.lens lofi artist

so relaxing tune

Incredible bioreactor 🌱

Hilarious!

Yes this is definitely part of the category and would love you to participate, nice tune!

Interesting article on latest Twitter acquisition and content moderation/curation https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation

Thank you for sharing !

g to the m

gm

love beastie boys especially intergalactic

Ghost earings worn by @caviar.lens

its the coke for me 🥤

👀

lol need a bit of Proof of Work from folks before entering into the garden

and new rappers are born

This! 💚

wonder whats the comparison to TikTok etc

and actually Snapchat they do AR

Will collect any paid rap content on Lens that has Lens in the lyrics. My max budget is 100 WMATIC (save some of that for others), LFG for this experimentation! 🎤 Mirror this for visibility and when you drop your tune, set mirror fees to get more distribution 🙏

is there paid collect support yet on Orb?

lol true

I am feeling so fomo!

I got 21 seconds to go...

I am most excited about ________ now

                                         fill in 👆 gap

How to we avoid it? breaking into smaller feeds/communities?

Yes but at the same time in Twitter there are lot of crypto folks that are just plain assholes haha :D

👀

The OG

Is this new OS?

Welcome 🌿

Very cool !

Looks very cool any way we can collect on Lens 👀

Got me thinking a bit. If someone builds a pay to follow (or auction to follow) module where the funds go to a smart contract that can be governed by the follow NFTs. We basically have a social Nouns DAO on Lens. 👀

Add it with the idea that each follow NFT could have custom art.

Nice so anyone can create own NounsDAO

Is that tune yours? Thats so good. Will DM

What do you think of a social app where you can only submit very high quality imagines? Could it be interesting for folks in 📸 community?

Welcome to the digital garden 🌿

It feels so right

Overrated: Elon buying Twitter
Underrated: Posting GIFs on Lens

nan

I know @odysseas.lens doesn't post much on Lens but know he is into web3 social so lets give him some hug follows to feel the power of Lens community and get him to post on Lenster 🌱 planting seeds 🌱

Love the songs in this playlist, perfect for Saturday morning 👌

same

Welcome to Lens 🌿

haha that could be funny. Brands would go an collect but actually it make sense. Imagine Nike collects every cool posts that relates to Nike - and creates a nice collection. Win-win.

It's happening

Incredible view - is that sunset or sunrise?

I do

very psychedelic eyes 👁

Nader dis tru?

I mean I think there is lot of potentail for Music NFTs wih social, where you own your distribution. I actually imagine that supporting artists directly by collecting NFTs vs. paying through all middlemen

gm nice to connect

whats the prompt here? I think you designed an interesting orangery

Every collect of paid Music content on Lens empowers music creator to steer towards self soreveign income

anon

I mean wellness is important...

was that EuroSpar?

Any rappers here?

sooooo cute will collect when back in laptop

👀

Silly question but who likes Mezcal?

Welcome to Lens 🌿feel free to be yourself

Happy Friday - lets make some memes https://www.rememe.lol 🍿

Welcome! 🌿

Was never expecting this but very cool to see some scale and its incredible to see how the infrastructure is getting better to interact with the blockchain

Looks delicious to me

I had a Guinness yesterday lol after almost 6 months I would say

Hope the right direction, he is practically talking about CultivatorDAO lol

Didn't know there is NFT SF, did know there is ETHSF, you should meet @bradorbradley.lens and @davidev.lens who are around

Part III and the Lol

Highlights Part II form The Economist - we all "own" your social capital now in Lens

ML back!

From the Economist on the rAAVE crowd

Just had an interesting call with someone and chatted about Lens, and one of the comments was "wow, people are really nice to each other in Lens". I think this is why everyone is enjoying spending time here ✨

Super excited about Arctic 🧊cant wait to join the sailing club

I will give my left kidney if its a new song

Full article https://archive.ph/iEWn6 enjoy fam

Excited about my new role at @aaveaave.lens as the Chief Mezcal Officer

Wish the Economist would drop the rAAVE article on Lens and charge collect and donate to @shefi.lens 💫

rAAVE took over Economist https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/27/the-surprising-maturity-of-the-crypto-rave-crowd thank you for the rAAVE vibes @paris.lens ✨

Anyone tried the staking mechanism on Phaver?

my fav

thats a good one

i heard institutions are coming

Whats your favorite Linkin Park song?

put on sale on @lensport.lens and will buy and will put mine back to port as well :)

lets OTC

yes Polygon grant, it’s actually possible to calculate the costs by gas prices but not actually that much of costs we will do a breakdown at some point

yess

yes we will have a breakdown at some point on costs but so far looking good

Just found out that mikeshinoda.lens from Linkin Park minted Lens profile and even cooler is that I was able to mint Follow Token # 20! Who is willing to trade # 1 for some GHO?

Question for music creators. Any idea what is the average earnings for indie music creators per song? I am wondering if there is actually a case where music NFTs could become a viable revenue source at some point

Actually make sense now - Lens is a permissionless social media profile - you don't really sign up for any data like email. So yes this is Satoshi based on my smol analysis.

nan

We just became frens on Lens 🌿

Nice! I am actually fomoing in

Congrats we all - we reached over 4 mm gasless transactions on Lens Protocol across all the apps 🥳

👀

That Marimba on the background sounded good. Do you own one or is that a sample?

This was soooooooo good. Also got a bit of daft punk vibes at 2:30 min in

Wait how did I miss this, how does it work?

Been incredible long day - woke up 6 am and been working until late. Sometimes time goes quickly and feels like there isn't enough hours in the day. It's good to be passionate about your work - still remember people to take a breath of what you are doing daily, especially during halloween 🎃

haha very moving event as well thank you Boys Club 💫

Hey if there is any bots (for reall) try commenting on this social experiment post

I iwsh I was a Designooooor

This is a very good use-case for zk in Lens 🚀

Sharing for all the designers out there. I personally appreciate the importance of design in products and how much it helps adoption. Super happy to see designers in our community

gm RomellHenry.lens

Where was this? Seen Solomun few times as well

Time to post more videooo

2 days from Halloween and I don't have an outfit yet. Any recommendations ?

Pledge your social capital  :)

I think for real creators (not folks like me lol) its even fine if they give small amount like 5-10% back by supporting new creators - its a healthy feedback loop 💚

haha could be funny - I could always ask 👀

omg 😱

yeah this is interesting especially with all the EVM compatible zk stuff going on. Would this mean that you can deploy solidity contracts on Starkware?

@yoginth.lens : )

Is it the same if you wait for 30 or so seconds or still turns into unfollow?

Welcome!

Pretty interesting take but if there is someone who want's to try Lens Protocol and does not have a handle can DM me in Twitter (soon DMs here). I like the concept of being able to buy a profile as a brand i.e. but rather see folks DMing. Appreciate the hustle tho xD

Been thinking about the Lens Analytics and something that would be interesting is to see net contribution, i.e. the amount you earn and the amount you spend in Lens. Would incentivise to put back into the Lensconomy 🪴

web3 life needs more poems ✨✍🏻

So I think management/leadership training is valuable but what I read the format looked crappy.  It's nice to always remind how not to be an asshole but its something that people tend to forget easily, especially for folks that haven't had expeirence in startups where need to be flexible and work as a team

@karmawav.lens that was couple of months ago. Also 3LAU OG one back in the days

I think it might be fine - let say that you are in community a) met this person IRL verification and b) this person is a chess player. So you could be in both DAOs/communities and verify both a) and b)

haha this is SO FUNNY! 😅

In testing.... soon live

I am sure this is something Yogi is working upon now : )

For me I see the Institutions are Coming meme. Besides that for 1) I think its banks opening trading desks 2) infra - AWS etc 3) "How can we leverage DAOs?". I the the last one is interesting since I feel every VC is trying to figure out how they could leverage DAOs

👀🤯

prolly nothing :D

Will be supported soon 👀

haha this is so good! Vitalik's dad

Thank you @levychain.lens for hosting me in your Podcast appreciate it a lot and all the good questions 🙏

Wow this is amazing thank you so much for sharing your music and exclusively on Lens. I hope this inspires others as well. a must collect, would have set less editions in the beginning maybe 50-100 ad over time increasing but I think this is going to be a hit!

definitely would see something that is optional in fact something similar to Uniswap Token lists that anyone can create one

What if you could spin out a community and verify profiles and give them custom badges? compared to Twitter where the company verifies

yeah I don't think KYCeeing folks is the way to give verifications. What I think is useful is that anyone can spin up a social verification community and verify users, content, anything. If one community does not verify, another community could

Lenster does have PoH badges on profiles if you are verified.

reorg

Would be cool to hear you set here 🙏

This is unfortunate but very true https://thefintechtimes.com/47-of-uk-banks-dont-allow-customers-to-interact-with-crypto-exchanges/

LensAnalytics shows now full revenue https://www.lensanalytics.xyz/u/stani.lens

Almost topping 500 MATIC 🤯 going to funds to collect posts that are creative 💚

Are you ready for 🎃

This is very cool and low the idea of showing Follow revenue as well! You could even add Collect revenue in total - Lensanalytics could become a nice place to see your financial analytics as well 💸

hmm maybe post a new one? because if its hidden in the blockchain world, I feel reposting would be okay

Should Lenster have commmunity based verification system?

Really love the Lens community. I feel that I have more freedom to post here my thoughts without the pressure I feel in other social media apps and also I see daily creators and power users coming back to support each others content. 💫 feeling blessed 🥹

I tried to even comment 👀

Good example how detailed prompt can be, expecting prompt composers to become paid gig (it kind of is with Lens collects)

gm!

Clearly I am not your level any time soon - so maybe rAAVE 2025

I capped to 10 to make the secondaries go moon lol

CC0 is the future

Haha exactly kind of stuff I LOVE to collect 🌿 Also noticed @christina.lens CC0 track 👀

Lens is where frens are

wow scary

You have such good guests! David is the best, one of the best people in the space and super nice to hear David's story

You have such good guests! David is the best, one of the best people in the space and super nice to hear David's story

Super cool to see - definitely Orb is getting good traction atm and would see becoming a go to mobile app for Lens & web3 social. Excited to see what kind of features could be cool to see added

Or in the future your Lens social graph lol

lmao then I change my mind

I do agree as well that it is one form of adoption and to be fair Reddit has had the closest vision to ours what decentralized social media could be but at the same time, not going far eought to unlock the social capital value by allowing users to own profiles. I think its a step forward

This is quite cool - we need that in our office and for the next rAAVE. What events that was?

I am a big believer in curation something that is very exciting for me is to use web3 footprint to connect people, i.e. the NFTs you have in common or protocols aped into.

Also I think manual curation has lot of value especially in the beginning of social networks, and even more powerful would be community driven curation

Kind of but maybe the big difference for me at leasy is that DAO are kind of digital organisations where people come together for common interest. Nation states do have form of governance but I guess the key factor is the decentralization - i.e. borderless etc. Really happy to hear more thoughts about this topic because in some ways DAOs might evolve to something like nation states with even their own territory (maybe in Mars lol).

Embrace Loom culture 🙏

What does everyone think about Reddit NFTs?

Congrats @shefi.lens & @maggielove.lens 💚

Hey all follow @shefi.lens & @maggielove.lens for some updates on latest work on SheFi and how they empower women in web3 ✨ SheFi has been focusing a lot on on-boarding women into web3 🚀

Wow Nader going to Lens NYC office 👀

If you could relocate to any city at the moment, which one it would be?

I think if you could do an action like follow and send a reaction like 🫡

That background is epic 🥥🌿

I want to collect more music.

That background is epic 🥥🌿

I have to say that from all the big social media platforms, Reddit is doing it the right way, all the way! Also regarding the tech stack as they are using the blockchain to get most out of the benefits you could have in their scale.

Welcome !

gm and welcome 🌿

Very interesting especially the part of sentiment analysis. Do the result differ much from the sentiment from traditional social media?

👀

I like how many different pictures you have of the pole with different perspectives

Welcome to Lenster 🌿

gm! You are 2 followers away from passing your Twitter follower base. Anyone sees this follow @jenningsf.lens 🤝

I have a feeling you would love Finland more and more. I think if it wasn't the coldness of its winter, you would live there.

She's a ten but she hasn't set her dispatcher on

I practically lived in libraries for couple of years so I feel you.

This prompt produced a verse where I want to retire

My ideal LensFest would be that we can get all the creators from LensFest to participate with Art, Music, Lights installations, Writing, Design, Product, Vision, Impact. It should be the fest of creativity!

If you could have a discovery algorith that made your wishes come through, what would you wish? 🪄

Amazing idea, definitely will be helpful and big kudos for the public building Loom videos

A must - mixtape curated playlist and DJs that are ready to go somewhere where folks never been before. Wonder if anyone has ever thrown a fest at a swamp 👀

This is a must 🍔 good amount of food for sure, for that to happen we need more foodies on Lenster? Any frens to recommend who can share more meals on Lens ?

What should LensFest have?

sick prompt !

Nerding out on Orb while eating dinner with @timlove.lens priceless

omg whats that region, he must done well on protecting the library

@superproduct.lens

Sitting on a Aave community call - really amazing to see decentralized building coming together

Congrats Colin for the raise https://www.theblock.co/post/179174/web3-publishing-platform-paragraph-raises 👏

Very helpful epic update 🪐

Not yet : )

This was beautiful, thank you for posting and I feel that we are blessed within the community we have ✨

Brainstorming is underrated

Pellegrino

Orb push notifications are amazing, helps to jump back to discussions and answer. 🙌

Curious about the public support and different ways it comes around. I guess its about support in general - i.e. because of your relationship with your neighbours you are able to borrow sugar

Attention is quite good, because it ties with distribution - your follower base is your distribution to attention. Interestingly, attention is something that can be over consumed, i.e. you see to many ads you want to unsubscribe

That is true - your social network / social graph as a social asset

Whats the best ways to "prove" credibility? is it who are following you? I kind of see following as an action of social verification

Not bad idea either : )

Where did you get your first POAP? mine was DevCon three

Signed property, I love to compare to vinyl records with the actual authors signature but digital

👌

wait lemme collect it quickly

Lens is the place to share 💫

I feel that @mixtape.lens has become the go to curator for Music in Lens 🌿💚🎵

Congrats on your first Music NFT! Feels good to collect this track. I know the feeling when you produce music and have your emotion in the work you have put into. For me the track mood is brings curiousity and discovery. Keep sharing more creativity ✨

Damn very good track - thanks for share, collected !

Thanks for sharing, interesting track!

Would really want to see this happen - especially creating some novel experiences and algos

For me the ability to collect user generated content is a novel concept here compared to bird

thats interesting, can do a module actually where you mirror first and then you could actually collects so you need to amplify

this could be interesting - also even when you post comments - could be cool to see each comment doing a generative art that can be collected together with the comment

Welcome! 🌿

Welcome! 🌿

Thanks for sharing ! Also you can now upload your music directly on Lenster 🎵 and it becomes a Music NFT by default 🎵🎵

lol tell me about it. BUT the biggest takeaway from this thread is that Lens community is very global which is the right way to build a community in web3. We are in the right path 👏

I feel like I was in one of them back few years ago? : ) would love to get someone from the team there who is around 🇪🇸

I agree if it would be a bigger event it should leave a good impact. If we would do LensFest - that would be the case. Poland is actually good. For meetups, they are smaller tho.

You should post more tunes - this one was vibes

so good

Brave ✊

Looking forward on these - big fan of your on-chain episodes 🫶

If this happens going to be big. Really love to see web3 businesses empowered by Lens 🌿

Yes - Lens Protocol is pretty much the only way now to actually own your own social identity and access the ownership to your social capital. Ownership also means acess control to monetization.

It's very strong candidate, especially to kickstart IRL meetups

We won't all get in....

We won't all get into Berghain so not sure

Really love this idea, and also alternatively Istanbul. Could be cool to have a retreat in "Mesopotamia" definitely at som point down the line

Very strong candidate atm!

Much love for Orb!

If you want to see some chic photography follow my fren @becauseiammichal.lens 🌿

Welcome Ian form Syndicate 🌿

These were good thank you @punkess.lens 🫶

Collected 💚😺

Collected 🫶

Collected!

omg this one is soo cool

Thanks for the share - collected 💚

I collected yesterday 10 wmatic for total of 10 copies of the Bedouin Flute song I made. Want to put the funds back to Lensconomy. whats the coolest content you’ve seen recently that deserves a collect? Share below 💚

What are social assets? i.e. what are the assets we create on daily basis with our social capital tha we as the users own and have control over

wow - can't wait to see the outocome 👀

gm Lensfren 🌿

gm

can't believe that this one was 1 wmatic : o I feel like could become soundtrack anywhere

v cool thanks for sharing 🫶

Which city should host the first Lens meetup?

Interesting question. I guess you could have both approaches but I also see value in being part of a circle and the more part you are with a same person in multiple circles, the stronger your connection is. it kind of builds an interest graph by default

gm 💚

Congrats! :)

What kind of a pill 👀

There are plenty of exciting things to do in web3 - its never too late to join the train

Love the You Right track! Also welcome to Lens 🌿 hit me up if you are going to be in London anytime soon. Also you can drop music in Lens and even set collect fees so folks can collect your tunes as NFTs 🎵

@kramps.lens does blockchain based episodes every full moon. Quite artistic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhgVOa7C6MI got touch with the guy to get more of these stories to @lenstube.lens

Welcome!! 🌿

Welcome!

Lemme help you https://haya.london/

This simply means that you are commenting someone's post whos friends of friend you are not yet :)

Best use-case for zk in web3 social will be to prove that you are teenager without disclosing your age or identity. Mark my words!

I think both form do have their use-cases and it depends what you can consume in that moment - sometimes you want to get tl;dr and occasions you want to dive deep. Somehow I am leaning towards having the same content in different experiences. Similarly as music has club edit vs radio edit depending on the type of consumption

I think its cominggg

Loved it so much 🎵

Well done @coopahtroopa.lens 🚀

you mean its a honour to become a meme? : p

Art cover kudos to @thegallerydao.lens and @selas.lens

Thank you @yoginth.lens @sasicodes.lens & @jouni.lens for the audio support. Minting my first Music NFT on Lens, rare. This is a small Saturday morning shakers experiment with a Ney flute. Very raw mix.


AI generated image using the @selas.lens text2Image engine. Learn more at https://thegallerydao.io. 

Prompt: 
Bedouin with a flute and women holding shakers around an oasis.

During Devcon all posts will be minted as a free collect.

#devcon @thegallerydao.lens @selas.lens @lensprotocol


interesting ! basically rewarding feature requests or ideas! and also memorializing them!

Might be a some sort of bug after upgrade flagging to @nilesh.lens

I have a cool feature request @yoginth.lens being able to generate your header image with AI prompt :)

gm Elie! Also welcome to Lens 🌿

I am compiling some entry resources where to learn more about Zero Knowledge proofs - if you know good credible articles that are easy for beginniers. Feel free to comment below 🙏

I find this idea interesting that .lens has become a signal on having a profile on Lens - long-term would just see @ as the solution and being able to attach multiple handles, ENS or creating own name space between frens

If you have a follower base less than 1k on any social media as a creator, it definitely makes lot of sense to switch completely to Lens. If you have less than 10k, might be good to keep both audience but ditch the other one when you are getting closer to what you aim for 🙂

wow looks v cool

gm

Enjoy! I am going to sitout this one - as I am still recovering from DevCon

Nope, no signing and no gas 🚀

how is it working? 👀

Anyone tried #Lenstopia with AI art?

Definitely coingecko vibes 😅

Currently this is not available but will be possible soon !

nice who makes those coffee bean packaging? you? 👏

Definitely needed and I heard its coming soon :)

Those followers are yours forever 🌿

Lol, I need to mirror this now to get you more followers

So cool to see how all the apps are integrating the music posts 🎵

So cool Orb supports mobile camera posting 📸

I'm ready 🎃

I've done it quite lot of times. I usually buy things that I believe will be relevant pieces in the future when assessing the past or content that I just find interesting or entertaining. I recommend to set 0.1-001 WMATIC collect fee with 10 limited collects to start the experimentations.

South London 🚀

Reallly tempting! Will be in London during 4th!

How did it go?

Welcome! Really fascinating idea of exploring how to bring brands into web3 economy. Lens Protocol could be actually a way for brands to share their content but also collab with native Lensfluencers in the future to share content across their network. The big difference about Lens and Old Social platforms is that in Lens everyone owns their profiles, follower relationships, i.e. their social capital 🌿

👏 Stop 👏 wasting 👏 time 👏 on 👏 hunting 👏 airdrops 👏 while 👏 you 👏 could 👏 spend 👏 the 👏 time 👏 to 👏 actually 👏 build 👏 an 👏 incredible 👏 audience 👏 with 👏 your 👏 content 👏 and 👏 get  👏 collects 👏

dunno but got some good vibes from this clip, collected

The part that is 54 min in

Such a playful tune thanks for sharing @christina.lens

Using generative AI art for support/cause is incredible idea

So were all gonna post music tonight, right? right? 👀

Look at this beautiful Shepherds Pie at Lens team dinner 🍽

This is music to my ears 🎵

Monthly active users on @lensprotocol across all applications 🚀

Based only on posting (mirroring and likes not included) ✍🏻

Congratulations for both of you Josh ❤️

Congratulations for both of you Josh, looks very beautiful ❤️

gm Honey 🍯

Lens team will be at ETHSanFransisco with @davidev.lens & @bradorbradley.lens 🌿

Be an active Lens user and some 🪄 will happen

So funny need this on rememe.lol

it was a must collect for me

This would be really cool. Maybe @lensport.lens could expand to supporting collectors <> creators relations

I think its a rug as well kek

Interesting as I've been asking the same recently. Feeling that GPLens would be the way to go

gm

I've seen some data dashboard, especially this one which is related to engagement https://dune.com/niftytable/Lens

Would love hear more ideas what you could actually do with data 👀

Welcome 🌿

Actually been also thinking why you couldn't create groups that you can name. Also would be interesting as well to create groups that are curated by a community. For example if you want to share content to all Finiliar holders.

I've been thinking a lot for a way to create scarcity and secondary market value for content. First of all the content needs to be good for collects. There must be something that is exciting for many. Then the economics. 0.1 WMATIC and max 10 copies. The amount is small enought to collect and copies is good size to create a small community around that piece of content. This way if the content is good and you miss the 10 copies, folks would find it on secondaries at some point.

and smell 🌸 also welcome to 🌿

Let me see, lot of cheese, means I do!

Wow I would surely use it! This looks quite smooth experience. Can you connect any wallet or you generate in-app wallet?

Wondered who in your Twitter is also on Lens? This tool helps to map out https://inlens.xyz/

From what I see it looks like Matrix right? i personally think many of the web5 are missing actually the most important prt which is the ownership aspect. Blockchain allows to own your social identity, social graph, pretty much your social capital.

Everyone is using Orb bc its the best mobile experience. My question is that should Orb focus on original vision of building on-chain professional network or pivot to general Lens app? Asking because many are using Orb for generally accessing Lens on mobile

"Ultimately, the social platform software that wins territory like “the best information” or “the deepest relationships” may not scale to a billion users — and that might be okay.  It may stay small, or scale one small community at a time." 

https://hbr.org/2017/04/imagining-a-social-media-platform-built-around-quality-not-scale 

An old article but still very relevant

Lens for sure but I am biased

True to the fact that there is value in the web3 social enonomy which drives people - same way as there is value in DeFi

We have the same music taste 👌

@mixtape.lens that u?

Is it going to be zk related 👀

Also there could be a verified list of anything that is related to Lens or apps build on top of Lens Protocol in GitHub that are known and trusted builders

Folks don't follow or collect paid follows that you don't know what the project is. Lensbeat is a good example that simply didn't tell anything what they were up to (they weren't associated with anyone) and disappeared. Simply promising random airdrop. IMO everyone who is promising an airdrop should be approached with caution.

@lenster.lens is global 🌎🌍🌏🌸

Welcome Denise  🌿

Try @orbapp.lens

👀

Very good podcast and what came to my mind about future of memes and NFT is that so far memes have been bought retroactively - i.e. Doge and NYAN Cat, with Lens you could actually create a meme and monetize on spot with rememe.lol and you could do that with small collect fee, someone else will sell for higher fee and higher so there is actually trading economy for memes as User Generated Content as Asset Class.

Happy to come to your podcast to chat more if you want to about Lens 🌿

This is such a cool idea. Will follow and collect

Does Berghain still exist there?

Congrats!!

Keep your social graph clean 🧹

Sweep all good folks that create content that is interesting for you 🌿

Remove all follows that aren't interesting for you anymore 🧹

Why? Everyone you follow is a signal of social verification, you verify user's legitimacy but also having a clean/healthy social graph would produce the most exciting content feed 💫

hmm I guess its a mix of deep house, indie dance, technoish ??

Welcome and congrats on your genesis post 🌿

Incredible to feel that DevCon was actually in Bogota. Never expected to visit Colombia anytime soon but I am glad I did

Sounds like a good initiaitive - the world needs more web3 education

Good vibes, thanks for sharing!

What if your GF is the DAO?

Very interesting take and I do agree there are layers that of music rights that can be solved with web3. Thanks for sharing 🙌

Followed them all 💚

🤔

Lemme gho

put it back lol

Can someone post the chart here? :) indeed its good

For the 1. I think this is a good idea and definitely should be implemented or at least notifications on @lensport.lens for 2. I think if you are able to edit an old post you collect would be quite interesting as a way to broadcast. Just a simple example is a weather app where you change the weather all the time and it reflects in the content you collected. I know @donosonaumczuk.lens had similar ideas on this - kind of having a visual oracle 👀

A question would like to ask Lens users, what does social capital mean to you?

Follow @edatweets.lens for some good web3 writings ✍️

gm

Any cure for jet lag? 😵‍💫

Very useful would be also cool to see how many posts someone made, given the handle claim is through claim.lens.xyz and it has the ability to do a genesis post during the on-boarding :)

There is one @orbapp.lens 🪐

Congrats Mike!

I've seen stuff like this https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vuechain/vue-ethers

but to be fair might be just easier to jump into React : /

Been on darkmode ever since I switched it on : )

And imagine all the mirrors that made revenue too. I've been thinking on setting small collect fee and limited to 10 copies. Let see how it goes!

Very gracious of you!

How did I miss you ? or did it?

👀

Collected my favourite

Lol I literally use the same setup. Would be cool to see also new video content experiences. Something really cool I have been thinking is that if you could enable token gated video content where you could have most of the video unlocked but then there is couple of paths, and if you are follower between 1-100 you could see some alternative ending, blackmirror style 👀

I would say that the most exciting part was to see so many newcomers in the Ethereum space. Lot of great talks (lot of zk talks too) and most fun thing was for me to give out Lens bracelets.

What is this looks cool

Everyday is a new leaf 🍃

This one was so good. Definitely think that DAOs will one way or another shape how people come together to work. The upside of DAOs is that you can boostrap a digital organisation relatively quickly and get like minded people together to support the same mission (or fight over the internet lol)

Just dropped my offer to acquire an insane social team to join the Lens team. Fingers crossed 🤞

Just made an offer on this ASCII 🐼 on @lensport.lens https://lensport.io/collect/8_97_1 hopefully the owner accepts 🤞

Now that the whole zk thing is happening, what are the applications you are most excited about being build with Zero Knowledge Proofs?

You are set to go 🌿

Everyone in Lens is experimenting ✨

What I love about #Lenstopia is that anyone can create their own interpretation, see https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x1d6e-0x0208

The original post on how to participate https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x1d6e-0x01a8

Give it a try and let your imagination flow 💫

Very fun experimentation, happy to see folks digging into #Lenstopia

I really love the idea of having multiple interpretations, this is what decentralization is all about. Anyone can come with their interpretation and contribute ✨

How can I collect some of yours? I love that second dog one

Folks that I follow especially @alexatallah.lens @mixtape.lens @punkess.lens and bunch of bunch more

Congrats!

welcome 🌿

Interesting experiment with few observations:

- Bird app full of typical spams replies (hidden at least)
- More engagement on Lens including comments
- Couple of collects 🌿

DevCon continued until my doorstep

Welcome!!

Welcome 🌿

Ronnie in Bogota

Xinobi meme

Looks very good, easier to read and follow the content flow. Actually can’t wait to see GHO there soon 🏃

Which Lake is that?

Use the only Friends and Friends can comment with 2 degree of separation, that will get rid of them pretty much

can’t wait either, heard Ronnie is taking a disco nap and will be back next year

lol need to redo my emoji game now feeling v old

love love

Who is new here on Lens? 👀

My point is that I love experimentations but I also think they should go product first approaches. Incentives are something that can follow when and if there is good utility for a product/community. Anyways curious to see how it evolves.

i.e. that you set dispatcher once, and should work across all the apps that use the same dispatcher, Lenster, Orb for example uses.

For Lens v2 this will be solved because you can do lot of delegations but for what if you set the dispatcher on Lenster desktop - will it reflect on mobile as well?

gm

Can someone explain me what is @lensbeats.lens besides an airdrop?

I agree that web3 is about owning your social capital which should unlock more opportunities for creators

I would imagine lot of interesting use-cases unlocked when you could even share collect fees with followers. Would enable creator funding

I heard some good rAAVE content incoming

mindblowing 🤯

glad you enjoyed 👻🪩

welcome 🌿

I think going to Montserrat was definitely an experience but nothing is as good as rAAVE

this picture is dope and the 🧢matches the 🦙

and by 6 pm you will be in berghain

gm and welcome to Lens 🌿

is it just me or is the Lens feed getting better and better

Goodbye Bogota 🇨🇴

I see technics on the right side 👀

I love the new Orb logo

Thank you all who I met in Bogota at DevCon! Was nice to see so many Lens users after just few months after the mainnet launch. We are really early on web3 social and those who are already here, know it. That means we have the ability to take the community to a direction we are most excited about. Hopefully we could do more Lens in-person meetups in the near future. 🌿

I decided as well that now its a good time to drop off some of the weight 🏃🏻

some kind of small and easy emoji-based reaction game

Thank you for everyone who came to see my talk on web3 social layer 🫶

very cool

If anyone from Aave community, today is the last day to vote on Proposal 106 https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=106 🗳 almost reaching the quorum 🙌

Oh wow @sameold.lens were you there at the event? Would definitely wanted to say hi 😊

I love the new notifications tab where you can filter the mentions. Now will be easier to keep track of mentions

Thank you all for DevCon now will continue to focus on Lensposting 🌿🚀

How do you feel today?

very cool especially for newcomers 🌿🚀

Love this app to see my Lens follower base and NFTs I own. Very useful to connect Lens users based on the NFTs they own. Try it https://social.mashmesh.knn3.xyz/dashboard/lens/stani.lens Build at ETHBogota 🇨🇴

Very cool, I love fishing 🎣 the art looks nice, collected

If you are around at DevCon today come at 1 pm local time to see my talk on web3 social layer. Will give some insight around how valuable web3 social is for users and creators and our experience so far with @LensProtocol 🌿

I met so many folks at DevCon that had a Lens profile. One particular incedent was memorable when a developer said Lens was for him the most exciting thing happening in crypto 🚀

Music people follow henri.lens 🫶

I saw this construction worker dancing on the side at rAAVE. The all time best was the two police men dancing on the side of the dancefloor haha

Welcome to Lens Henri, one of the resident rAAVE DJs! 👻

Very interesting stats on smart contract deployments, devs are definitely doing something

lol next time 🙏

He was so good!

gm

Post your best rAAVE pics 👻

lol this is funny

LFGho!

rAAVE Bogota getting loose

🤝

lemme find this

nan

whats your fav?

in case anyone is hungry

We brought some trees into rAAVE and they still have bananas on them 🍌

lol

Looks very cool seems like a way to spin up a community around an NFT collection. Wonder how many users it supports per channel

Whats the best mezcal for pre rAAVE?

its so so good 🫶🚀

Ronnie told that if you post content on Lens you might score a rAAVE tix

Hey Okytomo welcome to Lens fam to grow and own your digital roots and thanks for sharing amazing artwork 💚

oh totally this is so sick

rAAVE

love more memes

gm

Tonight 👻

I heard GALLiVANTER is in town

Super exciting update with aggregated feed support, i.e. not seeing same content twice 🚀

Would love to say collective thank you to you all who have been posting interesting content and also commenting on things I post. Special kudos to everyone who is collecting across the platform. We have an incredible community and I love the way things are growing 🌿

and social recovery built into AA 👏

welcome to the learning circle 🫡

Would anyone be interested in a spontaneous Lens meetup in Bogota during DevCon?

Show me your wrist game

Welcome to the fam 🌿🌿🫶

love the idea of time bomb 💣 posts would be very cool to build something like that where you could reward the users by revealing content

true not necessarily applicable for everything but good to experiment

Damn grew up listening this

Welcome Tim!

Was discussing with @alexatallah.lens here in DevCon and we were thinking that scarcity wise it would make sense to post free collects up to 10-25 limited collects. Could be good to experiment and see how they would do on @lensport.lens later

Thanks for stopping at the booth!

is!

ready for it

Who is ready to gho?

Gm DevCon day 1 🇨🇴

Good memories 🌅

Going to be there with a GM!

I think that the best way to move forward is permissionless access for users and most of the bot activity can be mitigated with the Only friends of friends can comment module and ofc curation

Looks like your solarpunk is ready for rAAVE with the jungle theme

👀

wow this is probably the best take on NFTs so far and where the idea of property drives from. Especially important take as you can create content on Lens that can be tokenized as NFTs, eventually becoming a propert you own.

300k shazams 🤯

welcome to 🌿🌿🌿

ser what does it mean 👀👀

My recent drink. Looks like Lens is entering in social space 🌿

Met Lenster fam @at0xnq.lens 🌿🚀check out his ai art its quite innovative 🎨👀

fuck yes

Imagine their next investor update 🤣

Looks like my kind of place or tulum

interesting how is it? whats your take? 👀

Forget the OFAC, there are some horses to be protected

gm

Some have financial capital but everyone has social capital. @LensProtocol makes you the owner of your social capital 🌿

Found @vadim.lens the wizard from Zerion 🔮Zerion has also Lens Protocol integrated, go check out 🌿

Has anyone seen my son proofofjake_ ?

🎨👀

Been recently thinking a lot about @lensport.lens and the value it provides to the Lens community. I love the idea of being able to get more insights on all the content that is created and collected on Lens, but also think seeing who else own the content, provenance are very valuable for the creators. Would love to see also some gamification as well where we could have leaderboards. Also the fact that LensPort supports royalties is sick, it means that you can earn whenever someone trades the content on secondaries 🚀🌿

Lmao so retro!

Welcome to Lens  🌿

Yup you can soon do that and its going to be epic

What I love recently about Lens is that one day you wake up and your feed is full of music, the next day its ai art, day after highlights from ETHBogota or disucssion on web3 adoption. You day always starts with a bag of enjoyable surprises and its all thanks to you all ✨

Ai art has really become a thing and feeling that Lens is the way to tokenize your art and distribute directly to your audience, with or without monetization

Celebrating the ETHBogota hackathon ending with a local drink :)

👀 Can't wait for CultivatorDAO to roll out community based checkmarks

The incredible memories from rAAVE Paris feat. Parallels

I'm ready, Ronnie!

One of my favourite hacks at ETHBogota was ZkZak which allows you to create verified credentials like "Solidity developer" and you can post anonymously while other folks with the same credential can up or down vote the post, creating a reputation system. More details of the hack here https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zkzak-tkbum

Beautiful 💚

We’re back fam! Time to dance 🪩

Super excited to work with Nader to help devs to build social media products on top of Lens 🌿🥳If you have an interesting idea to build or looking to integrate Lens, connect with Nader 🙌

According to LensPort.io I have over 5.7k owners of my content. Thank you for everyone who has been hitting the collect button either free or paid ones. You now own piece of my self expression 💚 Thanks @lensport.lens for making it easy to follow your content metrics

I definitely can see that it might take more time for the next market cycle and to be fair the space need some time to mature, especially with scalability with L2s that opens up new opportunities. I also don't think the next social media apps would be web3 Twitters, instead novel use-cases that keeps the users excited and the decentralized social graph allows you to hop from one app to another as the ecosystem grows.

Almost 200 hacks on ETHBogota 🤯

gm 🌿

Looks great, now time to collect some content 🥳

I think the next bull market comes from a specific unexpected demand. I think non-financial use-cases have lot of potential since a new users doesn’t need capital to interact with the blockchain and at the same time receive ownership. I am a bit biased but being able to create and own your social capital is quite big thing. The interesting part is in which form it becomes exciting for users to on-board. Really interested what could be s potential catalyst for a next demand cycle

gm doggo

Hey all ETHBogota hackers, if you hacked on @LensProtocol we will shippooor you the Lens DevCon swag 💚

lol could be interesting long term experiment :D but seriously its not a bad idea to have borrow position in USDT, because any devition from the peg means you save money

Just saw Vitalik at my hotel gym, surely he is prepping up to look ripe for rAAVE

A follow on Lens equals a lot 🌿 When your profile and social graph is secured by the blockchain, no one can take that follow away from you. You own your social network and the social capital you maintain through your profile. This is web3, everything else is the same old.

Folks who you think deserves more following on Lens? Artists, Musicians, Good Writers, Memesters and Good vibes. We all know that a follow on Lens equals a lot, since no one can rug your followers from you. You own your social network and any social capital you create 🌿

If you want to follow some good curated art, follow jodye.lens 🌿

Welcome 🌿👋

Had an insane degen flight to Bogota, no wifi for 10 hours, folks were trading OTC rAAVE tix, sharing Lens profiles and scanning POAPs. More folks were concerned about their Aave health factor than security in Bogota. Finally landed, topped up my collateral and ready to roll.

Ξ💚🇨🇴

What happened in the past 10 hours?? did another bridge got hacked? Did Xinobi drop a new tune?

10 hour flight to Bogota without wifi 💀

Nice any details somewhere to read how the DDos prevention works?

"Tonight the hot ticket to have is rAAVEs, where defi degens get loose" This one has some seriousss bass 🔊 Love love love it, a must collect

Super good questions and you will find some interesting answers during the green pill :)

What have been your most exciting paid collects you created that got collected or you collected? I am a big fan of rehash podcasts, they’ve been 5 wmatic but want to support the good content. Also fan of all kinds of content below 1 wmatic

Heard on the streets of Bogota someone said you can get a rAAVE tix if you hack on Aave or Lens during ETHBogota
